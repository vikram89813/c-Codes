					<description><![CDATA[SIMD types is a very bad idea.  Use of such types locks the code into a particular style of vectorization, making it less (performance) portable.

It&#039;s much better to add bits of language to allow the user to tell the compiler what is safe and/or profitable.  For pointer-heavy code, a directive to tell the compiler to ignore potential data dependencies is very helpful (in addition, insert request for something like &quot;restrict,&quot; but better, here).

Compilers have all kinds of transformations to improve cache usage, rework loops for better parallel efficiency, etc.  Do not constrain the compiler by forcing it to vectorize a particular loop in a particular way.  Tell the compiler what is safe and hint at what is profitable and let it do it&#039;s work.  It&#039;s the compiler&#039;s job to map to hardware, not the user&#039;s.

The original Intel paper on this cited cache utilization as a motivating example, with the valarray &quot;operate on all elements in one operation before doing the next&quot; semantics being blamed.  Fortran array syntax has similar semantics and vectorizing compilers have got along with it just fine.  C++&#039;s real handicap with respect to parallelization is ambiguous pointers.  Providing tools to eliminate that problem will go a long way toward improving parallelization.]]></description>
