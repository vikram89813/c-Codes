					<description><![CDATA[Unnamed parameters are often used to indicate that the parameter is not used in the function.  This means the compiler doesn&#039;t have an additional identifier that it will flag as unused, and the next person to look at the code understands that immediately.  Good parameter names do indeed make the code more readable, and if we&#039;re using the name to indicate the role of the parameter, an unused parameter should have no name.

Parameters can be unused for good reasons.  A function for a library callback may not use all the information the library provides.  A function in a set of overloaded functions may have no use for one of the parameters.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In your ambiguous example, it seems to me an alternative language fix might have been to forbid unnamed parameters in the declaration of a function.  After all, I seem to remember reading thirty years ago that named parameters were an important part of making C code &quot;self-documenting&quot; (which it was, compared to the e.g. assembler or Fortran which preceded it (directly, in my own workplace of that era)).  Unnamed parameters evade this important mechanism.  On the other hand, am I correct in recalling that C, too, permitted unnamed parameters in function declarations?  If so, well, then, I&#039;m egotistical enough to say that &quot;it shouldn&#039;t have&quot; -- since we would then have avoided this entire issue forevermore. If we simply stipulate that C did permit unnamed parameters, I can imagine the argument against forbidding them in C++ going something like, &quot;But look at the enormous volume of existing code that would have to be changed!&quot; -- to which I say, &quot;A one-time burst of pain is preferable to perpetuating an architectural error forever.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Herb Sutter,
how I can suggest a question for Reader Q&#038;A. I did not find an email address of you on this page.
Thanks!]]></description>

But think of the value of implicit &quot;it&quot;: seems that having would make easier to write tersely when matters. :)]]></description>
