					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s if you wait until July to register. Right now it&#039;s $695 for the first 100 people, then $845 until the end of June.

Note that CppCon is 5 days x many tracks (tbd but I expect about 5 week-long tracks), which compared to a 2-3 day x 1 track conference makes it literally a &lt;strong&gt;10x&lt;/strong&gt; superset of the content of GoingNative for about 2x the price (and note GN was run at a loss on purpose as a contribution to the C++ community), or 10x the content of either C++ and Beyond or Stroustrup &#038; Sutter for less than half the price of either of those. The organizers tried hard to keep the cost accessible while still having a good-quality professional venue that would facilitate attendees&#039; getting the most out of the event, and I think they did a good job.

Besides, really, for almost everyone the travel cost will be the majority of the total cost of attending, more than the conference fee...]]></description>
