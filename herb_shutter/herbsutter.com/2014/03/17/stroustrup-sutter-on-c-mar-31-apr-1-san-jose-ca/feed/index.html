					<description><![CDATA[In recent years as atomics have become more widespread and popularized, numerous learned individuals have blogged or otherwise lectured on their use in the context of lock-free queues. Very few however if any of these introductions ever bother to juxtapose a lock-free queue implementation with a more mundane mutex based queue.

It would be nice to have such a side-by-side exposition, as both have their advantages and disadvantages, and newcomers may not be able to readily distinguish the subtleties between the two.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@rhl: Sorry, the organizers charge for admission and we don&#039;t control that. You might ask them if they need volunteers though -- there are usually a limited number of slots for people who want to assist with things like handing out handouts and checking badges at the door, that get you free admission in return. That could make sense since you&#039;re local.

I don&#039;t believe the EE organizers are set up to record and/or stream the talks this time. Some conferences do that as a contribution to the C++ community, and I like to make my talks freely available when they are able to do that, but it&#039;s an added cost and effort for equipment etc. and not all events are able to do it.]]></description>
