However, the alternative one I showed should still be correct (this is a correction) though I believe it still has minor performance drawbacks so the one I showed is preferable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently watched the &quot;atomic Weapons&quot; talks and read through the slides (dated December 23, 2013), downloaded from https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=4E86B0CF20EF15AD!24884&#038;app=WordPdf&#038;authkey=!AMtj_EflYn2507c

On p35 this talks about the implementation of atomics for x86_64, and observes that there are two ways of implementing &quot;SC Atomic&quot; Store.  It is further claimed that it would be a bad idea to use the MFENCE alternative, because a single program must choose one way throughout.

I believe this is a misreading of the source material (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cpp/cpp0xmappings.html), which says that at least one of SC Atomic Load and SC Atomic Store must do a LOCK or an MFENCE.  Only one needs to, but confusion will result if sometimes it&#039;s the Load and sometimes the Store !

I noticed on p15 the distinction between &quot;Plain&quot; Acq/Rel and &quot;SC&quot; Acq/Rel.  This helped me a lot... thank you.  I wish the standard was clearer that not all &quot;acquire&quot; operations are the same !  In particular that a &quot;Plain Acquire&quot; can float up past a &quot;Plain Release&quot;, except where they refer to the same Atomic Object.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Jon: I do intend to write more here and here, as I have time... editing the new C++ FAQ (http://isocpp.org/faq) that was launched just a couple of weeks ago, including hand-editing 50,000 words from Bjarne&#039;s FAQ into it, consumed my writing time this winter. (I also updated quite a bit of Bjarne&#039;s text as I went, so please consider that my fall and winter writing output... I hope you enjoy the FAQ!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Magnus: Yes, we hope to make some of the C&#038;B 2013 videos available, but we don&#039;t yet know which and when. At December&#039;s event there were recording glitches and some other constraints -- see Scott&#039;s note here: http://cppandbeyond.com/2014/03/15/status-report-on-cb-2013-video-publication/ .

Of course, we have already made many videos available of previous C&#038;B talks and panels -- see the C&#038;B Video Gallery at http://cppandbeyond.com/video-gallery/ for a list of freely available videos. Thanks again to Channel 9 at Microsoft for recording these and helping us to make them available!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Herb: I think a lot more people have been asking for slides and videos of the talks. Not everyone can attend to the shindig be it for financial, time or other constraints - this is case regardless if it&#039;s held in another continent as well.

That said it would be really nice if say after a certain amount of time you consider putting up slides and videos of the talks to share with the rest of the C++ community, not just a privileged few who can afford to attend.]]></description>
