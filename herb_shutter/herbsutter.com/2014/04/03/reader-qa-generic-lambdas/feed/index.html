					<description><![CDATA[&quot;im personally not that impressed with compilers matching standard so nicely because i feel standard has done very little in 3 y so compiler vendors did not have a lot to do&quot;

The standards committees and compiler writers have been working on many things in parallel.  Some of them made C++14, some will make Technical Specifications to be released soon, and some will be in C++17, which is planned to be a new major release in less than half the time between the two previous major releases (C++98 and C++11).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Olivier Grant
1) I suppose it&#039;s because you have 2 alternatives:
The old and somewhat lengthy version:
[code]
template &#060;typename T&#062;
std::size_t distance( T const &#038;cnt )
{
   return std::distance(std::begin(cnt), std::end(cnt));
}
[/code]

The new, better version with concepts:
[code]
std::size_t distance( Sequence const &#038;cnt )
{
   return std::distance(std::begin(cnt), std::end(cnt));
}
[/code]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What is the type of a generic lambda? I know I can use &quot;auto&quot;, but sometimes it&#039;s still useful to know the actual type. 
Is it convertible to std::function? In other words, can I write this?

std::function&#060;void(int&#038; s)&#062; f = [](auto&#038; s){ use(s); };

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I had a few questions regarding the new generic lambda&#039;s introduced by C++14 :

1) Given return type deduction has been extended to regular functions in C++14 after lambdas supporting it since C++11, what limitations/problems prevented the committee from extending the syntax of generic lambdas to regular functions as well :

[code]
std::size_t distance( auto const &#038;cnt )
{
   return std::distance(std::begin(cnt), std::end(cnt));
}
[/code]

2) With the introduction of generic lambdas, is there any way to specify a deduced return type to be at least a reference ?

[code]
struct A { };

auto f = []( A &#038;x ){ return x; }

A a0;
A &#038;a1 = f(a0); // fails to compile, returns a copy.
[/code]

Of course, one could just specify the return type explicitly:

[code]
auto f = []( A &#038;x ) -&#062; A &#038; { return x; }
[/code]

But how to combine that with generic lambdas ?

[code]
auto f = []( auto &#038;x ) -&#062; auto &#038; { return x; } // Does this compile ?
[/code]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In C++14 can we use default values for parameters of lambda functions?
For example, 
[code]
auto f = [](int i, int j = 0){
        // Make something with i and j.
}

f(1); // calls f(1,0);
f(1, 3); // calls f(1,3);
[/code]

It doesn&#039;t compile with clang. Gcc doesn&#039;t complain though (shouldn&#039;t it complain?). I didn&#039;t test with VC++.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[note for gcc and clang, they might require compiler flag to enable cpp14 support(You can use Clang in C++1y mode with the -std=c++1y option.). and im personally not that impressed with compilers matching standard so nicely because i feel standard has done very little in 3 y so compiler vendors did not have a lot to do, except ms but they have  been known to lag. :D
if we dont get serialization, modules and concepts on cpp17 im gonna be very disappointed, but not surprised. :P]]></description>
