					<description><![CDATA[Based on my experience with C++11/14, BY FAR the most feared and controversial feature is &quot;auto&quot; and AAA (Almost Always Auto). Even after reading e.g. https://herbsutter.com/2013/08/12/gotw-94-solution-aaa-style-almost-always-auto/.

So I&#039;m looking forward to some new insights on this topic :)

PS:

I love consistency so I tried to follow AAA but the resistance is huge from others. So I wonder if in the end AAE (Almost Always Explicit typing) wins the hearts and minds.

Major arguments against auto:
* Hinders code review: Code review tools are text based. Cannot get type info by hovering over variable names.
* Hinders code understanding: Is &quot;proper&quot; variable/function naming enough to alleviate this?
* Fear of unnoticed mixed integer arithmetic: Integral promotion and implicit integral conversion pitfalls.

Minor arguments against auto:
* Does not work for declaring arrays, pointers and non-copyable types (you have to have at least a non-implemented but declared copy constructor).

Personally, I also prefer &quot;very strong typing&quot; which means &quot;always use explicit conversion&quot;. Unfortunately, especially for primitive types, it is hard to disallow implicit conversions.

But I guess we may have no option but to wait and see how this AAA vs AAE debate settles in the end.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hope beyond hope that Visual C++ finally implements dynamic stack arrays.  I&#039;ve been waiting for this feature for a decade - that&#039;s how long GCC has had it working as an extension.  Clearly, the implementation can&#039;t be *too* difficult, given that Visual C++ has had alloca for that long!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Herb,
We need &quot;Modern C++ Style: Idioms of C++11/14 &quot; yesterday, perhaps as a channel 9 video, if you ask me.

I can&#039;t find any good book on c++1/14. Most, even the &quot;completely rewritten for c++ xx&quot; are just rehashes of c++0x books with a few additions here and there.

I would like to be taught c++11/14 as a whole new language with only the new styles and idioms for simplicity and to help forget all the deprecated things I learned years before.

The subtleties and the when to use this and that old feature / keyword /idom can be postponed to additional chapters / reference books such as Bjarne&#039;s.

As is, I find it really distracting when a c++11 feature is presented in a paragraph only to be followed by 10 pages of when to use the old way. It really breaks the narrative. You begin to forget about the whole new picture.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;did you know that in C++11 you can solve this without relying on esoterica like double-wide CAS (which isn’t always available) or hazard pointers (which are deeply complex) or garbage collection (which isn’t in the C++ standard… yet)&quot;
Are we talking about a complete solution here that works under all circumstances or one of those &quot;tag the pointers and hope we won&#039;t have more than 2^k updates in-between&quot;?

I hope the talks are videotaped, but I&#039;m particularly looking forward to hearing about this.]]></description>
