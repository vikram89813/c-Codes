					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Do you know any C++ free graphic library cross-platform? I know that at a C++ con you were talking about some C++ graphic library which are very easy to use. Is any of those libraries free? I remember showing a small presentation with planets made in 3D and everything was made by someone from an Arts College.


Do you know any C++ free cross-platform libraries for Arduino? I want to buy one and play with it.


I don&#039;t work as a programmer and my C++ knowledge are not that big but I remained programming in C++. I tried Java or C# but my only love remained C++. I would like to improve my C++ skills (which are almost null) but I really don&#039;t have any ideas of programs I can try to build. I mean I saw those presentations at a C++ con and I was like: this is the same C++ I use? :p Still I work in an area related with programming: I&#039;m a automotive software tester.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Though C++ is on top and they mention C++11, the following makes me think the might actually have been doing C: &quot;Our C++ code does not use any specific C++ features such as objects.&quot; If so, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if a real C++11 version were faster still.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great. I&#039;m very curious to know what people at IBM have to say about trigraphs removal, they&#039;ve been supporting the EBCDIC world for ages now. I would be happy to see N3920/39 adopted (shared_ptr/make_shared support for arrays) just for consistency with the unique- counterparts (well, I have first seen a good use for them when I had to interface to other people&#039;s code known to return an array).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That nested namespace shorthand is great :). On the other hand, it might encourage more use of nested namespaces, and that makes me sad :(

Even better to see legacy things removed. I&#039;d love to see things like C-style casts emit a warning as part of the standard. You&#039;d suppress the warning in old translation units, but at least it&#039;d discourage use in new code and for new programmers.]]></description>
