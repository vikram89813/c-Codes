					<description><![CDATA[@Fabio: Yes, I&#039;m working on Effective Concurrency. You can see the progress in my EC columns in Dr Dobb&#039;s that I blog about here; each will be updated and become an Item in the book.

@Ben: I&#039;m thinking of updating XC++ for C++0x, but to get there will reissue the corresponding Guru of the Week articles over the course of a number of months, probably more than a year, so that when I&#039;m done I&#039;ll have the material to combine into XC++ 2e. I&#039;ve been undecided about where the right place is to post something like GotW these days: just here on the blog, on comp.lang.c++.moderated, on Stack Overflow, and/or somewhere else?]]></description>
