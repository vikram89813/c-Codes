					<description><![CDATA[One problem I have with that is that I don&#039;t know what to do with a partially completed destructor.  Once we enter the destructor, the object&#039;s lifetime is over, and any further reference to it can cause real problems.  Therefore, if we leave a destructor with an exception, we potentially have a real zombie object.  We can deallocate the memory, but if it had any resources (i.e., it needs a nontrivial destructor), we&#039;ve got potential leaks, and the principles of RAII are violated.  (This could be fixed by resume-on-exception; see Stroustrup&#039;s Design &#038; Evolution book, section 16.6, as to why resumption is not in C++.)

Presumably, also, if your output stream finds the disk full, it wants to do something like pop up an alert or uninstall your competitor&#039;s software or something else to gain more space, and try again.  If it&#039;s in a destructor, it can&#039;t try again, because the object doesn&#039;t really exist.  Either it handles a problem inside the destructor (in which case it doesn&#039;t throw an exception it doesn&#039;t catch), or the data is lost.  This is true no matter whether you propagate both exceptions or only the original.

In fact, if you propagate only the original exception, what&#039;s the use of the one thrown in the destructor?  It isn&#039;t going to be caught and processed anywhere.  All it will do is not execute part of the destructor, which itself is a Bad Thing.  The only logical course of action is to propagate both exceptions, and presumably therefore an arbitrary number of exceptions.  (Calling terminate() if there are two exceptions is an understandable rule.  Raising the number will only confuse things.)

This means that an exception handler can&#039;t be in a known state.  There could be any number of other things that went wrong that invalidate the assumptions the handler operates under, and the only way to know would be to examine other exceptions, leading to massive coupling among error handlers.

I believe these are philosophical issues, not technical.  What should happen when a destructor throws, and what will be the effect on writing C++?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Besides all kinds of technical issues, I have never seen anyone give a sound logical reason why you should not throw an exception during destruction.
Suppose you&#039;re flushing data to a file in the dtor. If this doesn&#039;t work ( f.e. disk full ) then you cannot use an exception to signal this.

The can’t-have-two-active-exceptions rule is purely technical. When unwinding due to an exception you could decide to not allow any more exceptions. Only the original exception is allowed. 
I bet there a number of other technical issue with this proposition, it&#039;s just that everyone seems to have decided that exceptions during dtors is philosophically bad, while the reasons for it are technical. 
C++ can&#039;t deal with it, for the simple reason that C++ won&#039;t deal with it. This is not to be applauded, it&#039;s just a fact of life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The big problem I have with context-dependent constructors is that they&#039;re really messy.  By definition, you&#039;re duplicating functionality, so you have to factor out the common elements into a function, and make sure both destructors and function are maintained properly.  Testing becomes harder, since there&#039;s two ways to destroy an object.

Given sufficient discipline in the programming shop, this could work.  In most of the places I&#039;ve worked, this would be of little or no value and just asking for trouble.

And, of course, it&#039;s one more feature in a language with tons of them to remember.

Therefore, I&#039;m very happy that C++ doesn&#039;t do this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wholeheartedly agree with removing the [[attribute]] and replacing it with keywords, but I&#039;m probably less keyword-averse than most.  

Speaking of which, I&#039;d love to see &quot;this_t&quot; (type of the this pointer) and &quot;return_t&quot; (type of the current function&#039;s return value) as omnipresent typedefs.  decltype(this) could do for the first, I suppose, but I&#039;m not aware of a good way to get the latter.  Maybe in C++0xB TR1?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Enforcing nothrow dtors is good... almost always. But I sometimes would really like to allow dtor to throw if stack is not being unwound -- obviously this kind of object requires special treatment, but it is better to have this possibility than not.
I wish C++ had ability to distinguish between dtor used during exception-triggered stack unwinding (that disallowed to throw) and &quot;normal&quot; dtor (that can throw), i.e. smth like:

class Foo
{
~Foo(); // normal dtor
~~Foo(); // dtor used during exception-generated unwinding
};

if ~~Foo() is absent -- it defaults to ~Foo()...


But I guess it is too late for that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another vote for adding new keywords, even if it means breaking old code. &quot;override&quot; is one example; I use it in Visual C++ and it&#039;s great.

I wish the same rationale was applied to C++0x keywords like &quot;enum class&quot; and &quot;long long&quot;. I&#039;d much rather they used new keywords, instead of mixing old ones together. It will be very difficult to search code for &quot;enum&quot; without finding &quot;enum class&quot; or &quot;long&quot; without finding &quot;long long&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it will be pretty nice to have base_check and override as keywords.

I hope they don&#039;t try to come up with a strange keyword replacement to avoid breaking old code...

Porting to a new version of a compiler often requires tweaks to the code base, whether there&#039;s new keywords or not. Expecting old code to run unchanged on new compilers is unrealistic. I&#039;d rather see sane keywords that require minor code changes, than crazy keywords.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, thanks for keeping us updated.
Has someone thougt about a c-v-qualifier(const-expression) like noexcept(const-expression) ?
So that the following code will work

class Foo
{
  int x = 0;

public:
  template  
  const(t_const) volatile(t_volatile) int &#038;
  get() const(t_const) volatile(t_volatile)
  {
     return x;
  }
};

int main()
{
   Foo f1;
   const volatile f2;
   f1.get() = f2.get();   
}

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the update, Herb!

I&#039;m glad to hear the horrible attribute syntax for base_ckeck and alignment goes away. Maybe it&#039;s a good idea to revive an older idea I saw somewhere (dunno where):

    explicit class foo {
        ...
    };

This syntax could prevent the generation of otherwise implicitly generated special functions and also force explicit hiding and overriding.]]></description>
