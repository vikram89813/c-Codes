					<description><![CDATA[There were more things worth mentioning under &quot;Other&quot; though not unique to 2010 specifically, but a big one has to be that a great share of stock trading is now done by algorithms, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/01/attacking_high-.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;attacks based on manipulating network latency&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/08/market-data-firm-spots-the-tracks-of-bizarre-robot-traders/60829/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;algorithms that are designed to deliberately slow down other algorithms&lt;/a&gt;, and that high frequency trading firms are shouldering each other out of the way to get a prime location inside the same building as the exchange because it&#039;s a competitive advantage compared to being just across the street... because the delay caused by those few feet at lightspeed makes a difference. Shudder. (I&#039;m not sure whether &quot;house of cards&quot; or &quot;tinderbox&quot; is the better analogy, but at any rate that would be straying into active commentary rather than just passive observation and reporting.)]]></description>
