					<description><![CDATA[Brendan:  You and I (and likely a lot of readers of this blog) like to be able to program our computers.  That&#039;s true of maybe 1% or 2% of the population, and leaves out most computer users.  Those people want to do other things with their computers, and the question is what the computer will do.  

Another thing that comes up in these discussions is multi-tasking, and that&#039;s something almost nobody, proportionally speaking cares about.  Somebody might care about running Pandora and something else, but that will be addressed soon, in the next version of the OS.

Similarly, the ability to install arbitrary applications is unimportant to most people, who simply want apps that will do what they want, and a large selection of apps to browse through, and the App Store provides that.

The iPad does neat things out of the box, and more with easily and inexpensively available apps.  It&#039;s convenient to handle, has a nice display, and the touch controls just plain work better than on my first-generation iPhone.  It&#039;s great for web surfing, with the exception of Flash, and Apple is doing its best to bury Flash.  (If nothing else, putting millions of easy-to-use systems that can&#039;t use Flash in people&#039;s hands will cut into its general use.)

The iPad is more of an appliance than a general-purpose computer, but that&#039;s exactly what a whole lot of people want.  The appliance trick has never worked before, but I&#039;d say that&#039;s because it has never been done well before.  That&#039;s the new market Apple has hit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a little surprised that the iPad is doing so well. I&#039;m wondering whether people are just buying it because it&#039;s from apple, or whether they&#039;ve really tapped into some new market that no one really noticed, or at least was able to deliver on before.

The idea of another computer that I can&#039;t program on doesn&#039;t really appeal to me, but I&#039;m curious to see what people really use the device for.]]></description>
