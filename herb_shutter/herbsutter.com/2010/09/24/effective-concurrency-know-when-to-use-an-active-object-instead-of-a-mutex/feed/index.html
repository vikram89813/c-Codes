					<description><![CDATA[J.J. Lee,

If your OS doesn&#039;t provide a multithreaded message queue, yes you might create one with a condition variable. Something like this (untested code, using Boost.Thread since I don&#039;t have C++0x threads):

class MessageQueue
{
public:
  typedef std::function Message;
    
  void Send( const Message&#038; msg )
  {
    boost::unique_lock lock( m_mutex );
    m_queue.push_back( msg );
    m_cond.notify_all();
  }

  Message Receive()
  {
    boost::unique_lock lock( m_mutex );
    while( m_queue.empty() )
    {
      m_cond.wait( lock );
    }
    const Message msg = m_queue.front();
    m_queue.pop_front();
    return msg;
  }

private:
  std::deque     m_queue;
  boost::mutex        m_mutex;
  boost::condition_variable m_cond;
};]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for such a nice article!

Is below a stupid question?

How to make message_queue work for a non GUI thread (without using PostMessage)? - &quot;If the queue is empty, pop blocks until something is available.&quot;

Is it OK for a mutex + a condition variable?
Or is there any better idea?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the nice article :)

I don&#039;t know if this is the right place to ask and get answered, but here are some questions:

Isn’t there a problem with the “queue” approach, if the “write” operation produces tasks faster than the log thread can consume them?
Can you give some good practices on avoiding that?

I usually approach the problem with fast producers, by adding a semaphore that blocks producers when some limit is exceeded. In this case something like the call to &quot;write&quot; being an async call if the limit is not hit, and otherwise being a blocking call (the check is based only on the semaphore logic). The implementation is something like - the semaphore starts from N, where N is the desired limit, producers do a &quot;-1&quot; and consumers a &quot;+1&quot;. In the case of a queue, the limit is the number of maximum pending tasks at any time. If N can&#039;t be fine-tuned at initialization time, the consumer can tune it as it works (though that may not always be a good idea?)
I would be grateful if you share some opinion on this approach in the case of logging and in general - the limiting of access with a semaphore, because i am not sure of its drawbacks.]]></description>
