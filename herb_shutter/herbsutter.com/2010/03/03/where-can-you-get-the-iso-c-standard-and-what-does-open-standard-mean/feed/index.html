					<description><![CDATA[Personally if the price point was more reasonable then I&#039;d be tempted to buy it. Early on in my software career I was introduced to Ada. The Ada International Standard has always been fully, and freely available and has always been recommended reading for Software Engineers who want to go past a basic knowledge of the language.

By making it freely (as in beer) available it has led to numerous people contributing to improving the language and to improving the readability and rigourousness of the definition.

This doesn&#039;t happen with C++ because only the &quot;experts&quot; really get a chance to be involved. It&#039;s all very well saying the door is open for people to contribute but there&#039;s a much higher investment required, not just in terms of dollars for the cost of the actual document, to get to that point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Open&quot; does not mean &quot;Free&quot;.  Why do people keep using these terms interchangeably?

This is a language spec so you can write a compiler, NOT C++ documentation.  It is exactly the same as being able to write HTML without owning the HTML specification, which is equally unsuitable as documentation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No, it doesn&#039;t &quot;presuppose that C++ is not for them&quot;, it presupposes that the C++ *standard* is not for them.  The standard doesn&#039;t tell you how to write C++, it tells you how to write a C++ *compiler*, so unless you&#039;re a compiler writer, then the C++ standard is not useful to you.

And yes, you should know the language inside and out before you can write a proposal for the ISO, because if you don&#039;t already know the language inside and out, then the standard won&#039;t make any sense to you!  Don&#039;t you think you should know the language inside and out before you set forth to write a compiler for it?

If you *don&#039;t* know the language inside and out, but still want to contribute your idea, then feel free to join the comp.lang.c++ news group, or contact one of the contributors by email.  After all, their email addresses are included on all of the proposal papers!  If your idea is really good, then these guys will have the knowledge to know how to do something with it.

I should also reiterate that all the other documents, including the final draft, are completely free.  The difference between the final draft and the final recommendation are very minor, so if you can develop a compiler follows the draft specification, then your compiler is already adheres to the standard better than most compilers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;And one of the things it contains is a complex programming language that’s hard enough to standardize on time by those who know the language inside out. The process would not be sped up or improved by everyone being able to spam their mailing list for free.&quot;

&quot;As for C++ specifically, I highly doubt C++ would become a better language just because your average C++ newbie was allowed to shout as loudly as those who actually understand the language.&quot;

&quot;Second, the rationale is this: the ISO standard is probably written for “the industry”.&quot;

From statements like the ones above I can feel that the C++ Standard is not for everyone, but its more for &quot;the industry&quot; and fo &quot;the ones who know the language inside out&quot;. If you consider sugestions from someone as &quot;spam&quot; and if &quot;shouting of an average newbie&quot; is annoying you, then you presuppose that C++ is not for them. So you automatically can&#039;t say it&#039;s free for everyone. I think that for a language to be called &quot;free&quot; and &quot;property of everyone&quot; it must be that everyone&#039;s voice has to be equally loud. Yes, maybe C++ wouldn&#039;t be a better language then *for the zealots*, but it will be better *for most people*.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Anyone who wants to pay for membership in their national body is able to come join the fun.&quot;
Yeah... OK, so maybe the next standard will be &quot;freely available&quot;, but only if you&#039;re white? :&#124;
I can&#039;t agree with the statement that &quot;free&quot; doesn&#039;t have to mean &quot;free of charge&quot;. Because the charge, no matter how big it is, still will be small enough for some people, and big enough for the others. So this IS a discrimination: for people who don&#039;t have $30 or there&#039;s too much overhead for them to pay [e.g. they are from a different country, using different currency etc.]. And whenever there is a discrimitation, whatever it is, you can&#039;t say it&#039;s free or open anymore.

&quot;It&#039;s a really bad document to learn a language from.&quot;
The worse for it.

You may not agree with me, but practices like these make the ISO commitee endangered by the concurrency, which offers &quot;more freedom&quot; and &quot;more openness&quot; in their language documents. I mean languages and standards developed by the truly open communities. Truly open, because really everyone can take part in the debate and work on the standard online. And everyone can get it online, at any time, without any charge or other discriminating barrier.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, you&#039;re saying that &quot;open&quot; means the price is less than some specific number? Say, paying 50 billion dollars for the right to be part of the direction is &quot;closed&quot;, and paying 380 CHF is &quot;open&quot;?

What is that specific price beyond which it&#039;s not &quot;open&quot; anymore, if I may ask? I might make use of this for my own marketing purposes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aside from C++0x, the language really hasn&#039;t changed much at all since 1994.

However, if you&#039;d like to read the rationale for the new C++0x features, check out the latest &quot;State of C++ Evolution&quot; paper at http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2869.html

Often the *last* revision of a proposal is the proposed wording for the standard (in standardese) but the *first* revision generally human-readable, and usually includes the rationale for the feature.

They also have a similar paper tracking the library features: http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2870.html]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree. The point is to reach that level, once you are there the issue of gaining posting rights is a different issue.

I can well understand if the list members wish to keep posting closed and understand that the fee is a very good way to keep people away who aren&#039;t sufficiently concerned.

As for documentation - I have felt a need for something like a rationale at times - there is the D&#038;E but it is clearly showing it&#039;s age - do you know of anything more up to date?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The fee isn&#039;t to lurk on the mailing list to understand a feature, once again, that&#039;s the purpose of documentation.

The purpose of being on the committee is to provide feedback, to sway the direction of new features, etc.  The idea being that you already have a vested interest in the direction that the spec takes as it will affect your business.  At that level, comprehending the spec isn&#039;t the issue anymore.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d accept that $30 for the standard is quite reasonable, as we all know there are many years of work behind it from highly skilled professionals.

The problem I see is the $1200 fee to lurk on the mailing lists trying to understand why something is or isn&#039;t done.

As it is right now there is an info dump (also known as committee mailing) 4-6 times a year and while that is very open and informative the constant flow of issues on mailing lists give one more time to internalize and understand the issues.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oddly enough, you have described the accessibility of state law back when I was younger.  It was only available as large expensive tomes with enough annotations so that they were copyrightable, so the only good way for a layman to consult the statutes was to go to a library.  I noticed no catastrophic problems from that.  While I appreciate the ability to browse laws from my home, I really doubt it&#039;s made much difference in people&#039;s lives.

After all, you really do need a lawyer to do more than study each individual paragraph to determine the meaning, just as you&#039;re better off in most cases reading books by people like Stroustrup and Sutter and Meyers than the actual standard.  I&#039;d say that the effort involved in comprehending the standard is more of a barrier than $30 for pretty much anybody wealthy enough to own a computer.

There&#039;s also the fact that standards cost money.  A great deal of cost is paid by volunteers, and a great deal of work is done by them.  However, there has to be a centralized administration to set the rules, organize things, maintain things, publish the standards, and the like.  It&#039;s not reasonable to depend on volunteers for the day-by-day work, or to rely on random people to host ISO websites.  It&#039;s really irrelevant to this argument whether the ISO is efficient or not, costs have to be met.

Standards organizations could be funded by tax money, and probably are to some extent, but that&#039;s not necessarily ideal.  It makes at least some sense for standards organizations to be supported by people directly benefiting from them, and that&#039;s one thing selling standards does.

Moreover, I think you and others overestimate the value of having a personal copy of the standard.  If you&#039;re implementing a full-scale C++ compiler, the cost of the standard is trivial compared to the scope of the project.  We can all learn the same language from other sources.  We can settle disputes by finding somebody knowledgeable; I know of free Internet forums where you can easily get experts to cite chapter and verse (I may be using the word &quot;experts&quot; loosely here).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I apologize if I misunderstood you.  I completely agree that there&#039;s so much administrative work required that the ISO really needs to hire full-time workers.

However, when you said &quot;part of the goal is ... to provide lifetime employment for the kind of folks who fill the ISO meetings&quot;, it implied that there&#039;s some conspiracy where the secretariats meet to discuss how they can justify hiring more people -- hundreds of people -- without actually having any work for them to do.

That just sounds paranoid to me.

Regarding splitting up the standard, I&#039;m not sure Python and Java *have* crossed that bridge, considering neither of them are standardized.  All you get for those languages is a reference implementation, which also gives an unfair advantage to CPython and Sun.

Now, sure, Python has the PEPs and Java has JSRs, and those are more granular than the C++ standard, but it doesn&#039;t make sense to compare them to the C++ standard.  It makes more sense to compare them to the proposal papers produced by WG21, and in that context they&#039;re virtually identical.

The only difference is that at the end of the process, WG21 takes all their individual proposals and compiles them into a cohesive standard, while Java and Python don&#039;t.

I really am curious if there&#039;s any way to better split up the standards work.  The WG21 has already created subgroups for the core and library, so these are effectively already developed as separate standards, even though at the end of the day they&#039;re printed on the same paper.  It was the library group, for instance, that brought you TR1.

And I&#039;m sure you don&#039;t fall into the category that thinks C++ is too flawed to be broken up, because you&#039;ve already said that &quot;It’s entirely possible to standardize something like C++ under IETF rules&quot; and &quot;IETF standards are only &#039;relatively simple&#039; because the C++ standard ... should have been split into several separate standards&quot;.

Like I said, this topic interests me, so if you have any actual ideas about how C++ can be broken up into different standards, or an example of another programming language that has been broken up into separate standards (aside from core and library, since C++ already does that) then I&#039;m all ears.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mark, this is a good thought experiment. I think it would still be just as much of an issue. Consider if the penal code in your area was not free for copying - you could download a .pdf for a small fee, and it was illegal to copy it. Obviously there is not nearly as much at stake here, but I think it is problematic for similar reasons. The decisions in it may be totally arbitrary, but they create reality for the rest of us. I&#039;m not interested in them because they are good, I&#039;m interested in them because they are telling me what to do and in a sense how I must do it. I&#039;m not interested in a book on language design - that would make sense to charge for - I&#039;m interested in a set of arbitrary decisions that affect how I must work.

The fact that the copyright prevents free distribution is at odds with this, considering that the language is considered open. It makes the language, in a sense, not open. It&#039;s still open in that I don&#039;t need to pay a license to implement the standard or use &quot;C++&quot; in marketing materials, but it is not open in that I am being told I must do something but I can not freely find out what I am being told to do.

I want to also point out that the money we pay for this document is not going to reimburse the authors for their time. We are not paying Herb here like we are if we buy his books. This is not an attempt to freeload off his work - and I don&#039;t care about the standard&#039;s literary value.

It is valuable only insofar as it is distributed, and I want it to be freely distributed so that all compilers will implement the same language, disputes about language details can be settled easily by an authoritative source, we can all learn the same language, etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This thread feels in parts like an almost academic discussion about a trivial 30$ for a pdf file.

In other parts, it reveals the C++ community is frustrated and powerless that is not better organised. I agree, but who is listening to those arguments that can/will do something? I&#039;m over it.

If the same people (including me) had contributed as much heat and thought out argument into the mechanisms that already exist - whatever the faults are with it - to get something tangible like the Concepts or Modules specification through sooner, instead of wasting energy on trying to define &quot;free&quot; or whatever we are doing here (?), then maybe Concepts and Modules would have made it into the next standard after all and the 30$ would have been money even better spent.

So head on over to cpp-next.com or groups.std.c++ or wherever and contribute as heavily on those more tangible topics too is all I can say, because trying to define free isn&#039;t likely to get anywhere.

If only we could combine groups.std.c++, cpp-next.com, boost, artima, and stackoverlfow into some kind of more organised &quot;all about&quot; c++ thing, where we contributions could really feel collected and acted on - maybe that would move c++ forward quicker.

Anyway, Herb, close this thread and talk about something else! :)]]></description>

There&#039;s so much negotiation involved, and so much red tape, that even with administrative staff to help the committee chairs etc. pretty much have to devote more time to it than they could afford if they had another full-time job.  I&#039;ve had several colleagues over the years who were engaged full time in this way, and I&#039;ve talked to them about their work.  There really are people like that, and they&#039;d be devastated if such work became harder to find.  [...]

David: interdependencies between separate specs are a common issue in standards.  Do you think the IETF specs aren&#039;t all full of mutual dependencies, or that the ISO specs for mechanical/electrical components aren&#039;t?  Somehow, though, they manage to handle it.  Even other programming languages, such as Java and Python, have crossed this same bridge before.  Splitting compiler and library is just the very roughest cut.  In general, for any well written spec, it should be possible to take most of the major sections (usually excluding the first few that describe the true core) and make them separate specs with just a bit of verbiage in the main spec referring to them.  If the interdependencies are too strong for that, it&#039;s a strong indication that the original spec - or the thing it describes - is very seriously flawed in ways that no standards process can address.

Of course, some would argue that C++ fits that description, and that the very reason why the spec can&#039;t be broken up is also a reason to avoid C++.  That might be a fun discussion to have, but perhaps not in this comment thread.]]></description>

[I definitely disagree that standardizing something like C++ under IETF rules is as simple as Jeff makes it sound, but] the question of how the standard could be split up is a somewhat interesting one.  The first thing that came to mind was concepts, which the WG chose to drop from the next standard rather than fixing the loose ends.

Is there any way to isolate such a feature into a separate standard?

It seems like a tall task to me.  That feature touches so many other portions of the standard that it seems nearly impossible to isolate it, unless the new standard was developed as a &#039;patch&#039; for the base standard.  (And, in effect, that *is* how it was developed, albeit not as a separate standard.)  C++ isn&#039;t designed as a &#039;stack&#039; like TCP/IP, and it&#039;s difficult to imagine how it could be redesigned as such while still being human-readable.

Maybe if/when C++ accepts Daveed Vandevoorde&#039;s modules proposal, it would be easier to add a feature to C++ which would allow users to &#039;import&#039; different language features (eg &quot;import templates&quot;, &quot;import exceptions&quot;, or &quot;import cpp03&quot;).  That would also be kind of cool, because it would make it easier to deprecate old features on a per-module basis, or, depending on the flexibility of the module format, you could even compile your modules from a completely different language!

Of course, even if you could figure out a way of doing this (acknowledging that I made it sound at least two orders of magnitude easier than it would really be) is it desirable?  Or would it mean that users are less able to rely on a common baseline in their compilers?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Avdi: Are you *seriously* using the WWW as an example of how *free* standards are superior? Seriously? Last I checked, HTML wasn&#039;t much of a standard. It&#039;s a mess. It sucks. No browser follows the spec, which is just as well because no web designer does either. 

The ISO version of &quot;openness&quot; has yielded thousands of actual standards: Standards that countless companies have been able to follow, allowing them to interoperate. 

As for C++ specifically, I highly doubt C++ would become a better language just because your average C++ newbie was allowed to shout as loudly as those who actually understand the language.

Standards organizations do not cater to you. Their relevance is in ensuring interoperability between those who care. Between Visual C++ and GCC. Between different shoe manufacturers. Between the container sizes used by different shipping companies. ISO is set up to handle more than Joe Bedroom Coder who wants to understand C++ without spending a cent.

No, just because your web browser has &quot;moved on&quot; and is free today, that doesn&#039;t mean that &quot;the world&quot; has moved on. The world is big and complex and contains quite a lot of diversity. And one of the things it contains is a complex programming language that&#039;s hard enough to standardize on time by those who know the language inside out. The process would not be sped up or improved by everyone being able to spam their mailing list for free.

Lots of open source software costs money as well. Is that offensive too? Should we start a crusade against the open source movement for daring to use the word &quot;open&quot; to describe themselves, when they don&#039;t absolutely guarantee free access?

Or perhaps you should just accept that &quot;open&quot; means the same as it did 20 years ago. It didn&#039;t mean &quot;free&quot; then, and it doesn&#039;t mean &quot;free&quot; today.

As for the openness of the C++ standard: You and I can use it and follow it to the letter without spending a cent. Yes, I have to pay a nominal fee to get access to the document, but even if I don&#039;t have it, I won&#039;t be hit by a lawsuit if I dare to write a C++ program. I can use a C++ compiler without paying for the standards document. I don&#039;t need a license. The compiler writers didn&#039;t need a license. What the standard *describes* is absolutely free and open. So what if they charge a fee for the actual description?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think it *is* possible to interpret &quot;open&quot; vs. &quot;non-open&quot; in absolute terms, because different organizations favour different kinds of openness.

The ISO charges for access to their Final Standards.  The IETF uses &quot;rough consensus&quot;, as determined by the chairperson, rather than a formal voting process.  The WHATWG&#039;s steering committee is invitation-only.  None of them are 100% open.

And these different kinds of openness make sense.  For instance, the IETF works great for relatively simple protocols that people mostly already agree on, but which need to have the bike-shed stuff standardized.  C++, on the other hand, has too many interested bodies with widely different goals for the standard for it to prosper if it was developed under the IETF, without a more formal voting system.  It would be impossible to simply use a &quot;rough consensus&quot; and get anything done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Access to the C++ standard is restricted?  Does that mean I need a prescription from my doctor to buy it?

Listen, anybody who can afford a computer can afford $30.  *Especially* if that person has written a C++ compiler that already meets the C++ Draft Specification.

Also, unrestricted *access* isn&#039;t the most important part.  Unrestricted *use* is the most important part, and the C++ standard surely meets this criteria, as anybody is allowed to write and distribute a C++ compiler without paying a licensing fee.

To recap:

* Anybody is allowed to partake in the creation of the standard.
* Anybody can download the papers and follow the development of the standard.
* Anybody can download the Final Draft, which is nearly identical to the Final Standard.
* Anybody can purchase the Final Standard for a nominal fee.
* Anybody can use this standard to write and distribute their own C++ compiler.

If you know anything about specifications, you have that admit that that&#039;s more open than most standards.

Compare that to the IETF&#039;s RFCs, which *are* free, but *aren&#039;t* necessarily developed in an open way.  You can comment, but that doesn&#039;t mean you get a vote.

I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s a bad thing -- it certainly has less overhead -- but it&#039;s not completely open either.

So unless you&#039;re one of those open-source ultra-zealots that claims that the GPL isn&#039;t open enough (compared to the MIT license, or the public domain) then you have to draw the line somewhere, and you would have to be crazy to put C++ on the same side of that line as the .DOC specification.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Access to the C++ standard is restricted?  Does that mean I need a prescription from my doctor to buy it?</p>
<p>Listen, anybody who can afford a computer can afford $30.  *Especially* if that person has written a C++ compiler that already meets the C++ Draft Specification.</p>
<p>Also, unrestricted *access* isn&#8217;t the most important part.  Unrestricted *use* is the most important part, and the C++ standard surely meets this criteria, as anybody is allowed to write and distribute a C++ compiler without paying a licensing fee.</p>
<p>To recap:</p>
<p>* Anybody is allowed to partake in the creation of the standard.<br />
* Anybody can download the papers and follow the development of the standard.<br />
* Anybody can download the Final Draft, which is nearly identical to the Final Standard.<br />
* Anybody can purchase the Final Standard for a nominal fee.<br />
* Anybody can use this standard to write and distribute their own C++ compiler.</p>
<p>If you know anything about specifications, you have that admit that that&#8217;s more open than most standards.</p>
<p>Compare that to the IETF&#8217;s RFCs, which *are* free, but *aren&#8217;t* necessarily developed in an open way.  You can comment, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you get a vote.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s a bad thing &#8212; it certainly has less overhead &#8212; but it&#8217;s not completely open either.</p>
<p>So unless you&#8217;re one of those open-source ultra-zealots that claims that the GPL isn&#8217;t open enough (compared to the MIT license, or the public domain) then you have to draw the line somewhere, and you would have to be crazy to put C++ on the same side of that line as the .DOC specification.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I did read the post, but I don&#039;t feel it correctly matches the definition of open. For it to be open, it must be available to everyone with no barrier to entry. By charging for the final standard, that&#039;s a clear barrier to entry.

Do not confuse &quot;open to comments&quot; with open. Just because domain experts are allowed to partake in the creation of the standard does not make it open; that&#039;s really only really half of the equation. Unrestricted access to the final standard is &quot;open&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Luckily, the ISO and the Open Group have never called themselves &#039;free&#039;, just &#039;open&#039;.

					<description><![CDATA[I certainly hope we&#039;re both attacking each other&#039;s arguments and not each other, and if I gave any intimation to the contrary I&#039;m sorry.

When I write portable code, I am interested in having it run widely.  I don&#039;t see that writing standard-conforming code as a worthwhile goal in itself, but rather an extremely useful technique for making it work on all sorts of systems, including ones that have not yet been developed.  Code that must work on any conforming platform is very good to have, because most platforms make a real effort to be conforming, and will continue to.

I still don&#039;t see the value in a copy of the Standard here.  I can learn to write conforming code without it, and for practical purposes I can&#039;t rely on it to show me what&#039;s really portable.  It&#039;s neither necessary nor sufficient for portability.  It&#039;s a really bad document to learn a language from.  It can be hard to determine whether a certain construct is conforming, and in fact the best way is often to ask on free internet forums.

The Standard is invaluable for language implementors, but in this case a $30 copy of the Standard is not a significant additional burden.

In short, I&#039;m not seeing where anybody is going to be significantly harmed by paying $30 or so for a copy of the Standard.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I understand that this was once a perfectly acceptable interpretation of the word &quot;open&quot;, but the software world has moved on. Groups like the  IETF, W3C, and WHATWG - not to mention the Open Source movement as a whole - have set a new bar for what it means to be &quot;open&quot; in computing. And by and large the standards emanating from those groups have been the better for being transparently and publicly debated, and made available for free. 

Not to mention the positive effect the new openness has on standards adoption. I can &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.github.com/discussions/site/1151-api-returns-403-when-rate-limiting&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tell Github&lt;/a&gt; that I think they are using the wrong HTTP response code in a web service, and they can google &quot;http response codes&quot; and check it for themselves in a matter of seconds. They would be less likely to do that if they had to purchase some PDF and search through it.

The ISO version of &quot;openness&quot; is one of the reasons the English-speaking Ruby community has largely taken the view that the effort to create an ISO standard around Ruby is irrelevant and not worth their attention. I recently created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruby-standard.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; just so interested people could have a place to openly pick apart and discuss the draft Ruby standard. I shouldn&#039;t have had to do that.

I&#039;m in the camp that thinks standards are useful and worthwhile efforts. C++ in particular has benefited from a robust standardization process. The world has changed, though; for the better in my opinion. &quot;Open&quot; means more than it ever has before, and that&#039;s a good thing. Standards organizations would do well to embrace the new openness, or risk decreasing relevance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, but those documents are copyrighted, and you must agree to the terms and conditions, which includes:

&quot;You are NOT permitted to amend, copy, reprint, offer for sale, or otherwise re-use material from these documents without explicit written permission from The Open Group.&quot;

This is the antithesis of the GPL.  Luckily, Open Group is open in different ways, most notably that anybody is allowed to implement the standards.

Also, for the record, the ISO was responsible for a significant portion of that standard, so in effect, you *are* getting a standard from the ISO that&#039;s free-as-in-beer.

But seriously, if anybody is confused about what an &quot;open standard&quot; is, just look it up on Wikipedia.  They&#039;re &quot;open&quot; because they&#039;re royalty free, not because you can freely modify and re-distribute them.  That&#039;s useful for software, but it would make it literally *impossible* to develop a standard.]]></description>
