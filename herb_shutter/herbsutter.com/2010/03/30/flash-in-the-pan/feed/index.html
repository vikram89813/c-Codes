					<description><![CDATA[I wholeheartedly agree with your flash dislike, especially because of how slowly it runs on my Mac.  I wanted to suggest an in-between alternative for you.  There are a few &quot;flash block&quot; extensions for chrome available and the one I use works really well.  Instead of a whole bar at the top asking you to install flash, you get a small no-flash icon in the address bar.  Then, for something you really want to see using flash, you can click on the icon to quickly enable it for the lifetime of that tab.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@all: Cool. I didn&#039;t use Flashblock because (a) I try to use minimal plugins (usually &#060;4 including Flash) and (b) I didn&#039;t know about that one otherwise in this case I would have resorted to it already to try to solve the problem. I&#039;ll try it.

@Dusty: Cool! That they would announce better Flash support this very day. I see they were polite enough not to mention the chronic crashing issue. :) Hopefully a non-developer release of Chrome that includes improved Flash support will be available soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like you want the Flashblock extension.  I use it on Firefox, but it&#039;s also available on Chrome.  With the extension, you&#039;re not annoyed by the plugin bar, and when you really need to you can run the flash with one more click.

&quot;Flashblock is an extension for the Google Chrome that blocks all Flash content from loading. It then leaves placeholders on the webpage that allow you to click to download and then view the Flash content.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb,

Why don&#039;t you use flash-blocking Chrome extensions, e.g. https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gofhjkjmkpinhpoiabjplobcaignabnl ?

Basically it does the same as uninstall but
a) you don&#039;t see a cute little bar at the top
b) you can manually enable any flash object]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah a lot of people say HTML5 video has no benefit over flash but here&#039;s what I&#039;ve noticed on youtube (chrome on linux vs firefox with flash on linux):

+ Much, much snappier interface.
+ You can change the playback speed!
+ &#039;Scrubbing&#039; through the video is extremely fast.
+ Page loads much faster (no plugin to load!)
+ Doesn&#039;t crash browser (for some reason flash crashes firefox on exit every time)
+ No reload when you change the video size.
- No fullscreen mode yet afaict. I think it might work on windows.
- Appears to be using nearest-neighbour filtering on the video.
- Not sure if subtitles/annotations work yet (although maybe that&#039;s a plus!)

They&#039;ll need to add a &#039;Don&#039;t ask again&#039; option to the &quot;You need to install a plugin&quot; bar at some point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A slightly less radical solution (at least in Chrome and Firefox, don&#039;t know about other browsers) would be to install FlashBlock.
It makes browsing much more pleasant and still gives you the option to see selected Flash content with the click of a button.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why aren&#039;t you using FlashBlock? I&#039;ve been using FlashBlock by default for years, both with Firefox and now Chrome (which is not my main browser - I believe menus are superior to cryptic toolbars).

I also disable Quicktime, Windows Media Player, Realplayer etc. plugins, as well as PDF plugins. In fact, the only plugin I enable is Flash, but that&#039;s conditional on a case by case basis with FlashBlock.

PDFs are the biggest security risk, but I don&#039;t trust other media players either.]]></description>
