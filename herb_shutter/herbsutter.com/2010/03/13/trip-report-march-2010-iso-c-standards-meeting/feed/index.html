					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb, great news!
What about the feature that we discussed while you were in Tokyo, about making noexcept as strong as const (e.g. only noexcept code can be called from noexcept etc?)
In this case it will be much easier and safe to write exception-safe code:
void f()
{
 // code that may throw
 vec.insert(3); // may throw
 ...
 // done with trowing code, now calling only no-throw stuff
 noexcept
 {
    vec.size(); // ok, vector::size is noexcept
    vec.insert(5); // will not compile, as vector::insert may throw
 }
}]]></description>

I&#039;m not saying such a thing shouldn&#039;t exist, after all people need to write cross platform code sometimes. However, it&#039;s kind of misleading to present it as making non-throwing functions more efficient, when to my knowledge they are already free on GCC...

					<description><![CDATA[&#062; Exceptions have zero run time overhead if they are not thrown.
Not true for all implementations, notably VC++.
Even with no apparent runtime overhead, exceptions can still have an effect on generated code that is executed.

&#062; If noexcept is being added only for optimisation opportunities then
&#062; there is no point whatsoever.
With some compilers, functions that need exception-handling code cannot be inlined. The &quot;throw()&quot; clause means that in effect, the function must be enclosed in a function try-block, with something to catch any exception that escapes. All this means  possibly less-efficient code and loss of inlining.

One motivation for the &quot;throw()&quot; clause on a function F is helping the compiler to optimize functions that call F. If a function G makes no calls that could result in an exception, additional optimizations might be available. In particular, if G  is declared with &quot;throw()&quot;, the extra code to catch an errant exception can be omitted, allowing G to be inlined.

The &quot;noexcept&quot; keyword means that a compiler could probably omit all inefficiencies, and allow inlining of the function;  terminate could be called by existing mechanisms. The result would be absolutely zero cost for the declaration, in addition to the existing gains from knowing the function cannot exit via an exception.

&#062;I *am* struggling to understand how the somewhat awkward,
&#062; double-negative nothrow(false) could be of any use.
Almost always you will use &quot;noexcept&quot;. The &quot;noexcept(b)&quot; form, where b is a boolean expression, allows noexcept to be conditionally specified via a constant-expression or template argument.
noexcept(true) is exactly equivalent to noexcept.
noexcept(false) is exactly equivalent to omitting noexcept.
I would not expect any programmer to write &quot;noexcept(true)&quot; or noexcept(false)&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything in this spec that would interfere with adding a static requirement to future version of the standard, or with vendors that would like to optionally check it statically.

The problem they&#039;re trying to solve is that throw() is currently optimized in some compilers, and prevents optimization in others.  A programmer should be able to rest assured that nothrow will never make their performance *worse*.

The problem with making nothrow statically checked *today* is that there&#039;s huge amounts of code that doesn&#039;t include nothrow, so if a nothrow function can only call other nothrow functions, then you&#039;re going to have to add a lot of try/catch blocks in code that you *know* isn&#039;t going to throw an exception, and that&#039;s the *opposite* of an optimization.  The only alternative I can think of is adding some sort of nothrow_cast.

I can also understand why the WG would want to be conservative this late in the standardization process, after what happened with &#039;export&#039; during C++98.  I don&#039;t think this would be as difficult to implement as export, but it may have some unforeseen side-effects, especially if there&#039;s no known implementation.

Now, I *am* struggling to understand how the somewhat awkward, double-negative nothrow(false) could be of any use.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a nothrow version of new...

Non-throwing code is a special case in C++, most functions can throw and you usually should just write exception safe code with std::shared_ptr or whatever.

Most C++ users never even knew about the existence of old style exception specifications, and Visual Studios never implemented them...

If we had no noexcept, I don&#039;t think it would be a tragedy... however, I do think it&#039;s kind of pointless to do it at all unless it is static.

If it were static I suspect it would mostly be used to provide callbacks for C libraries, and other cases where a callback can&#039;t throw. If it is dynamic I suspect it won&#039;t be used, and probably not widely implemented, as that&#039;s what happened with throw().]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of the introduction of const.  Way back when, in the days of K&#038;R C, there was no such thing as const.  When it was introduced, there was a whole lot of C code that didn&#039;t use const, and this greatly slowed its adoption.  Nevertheless, it&#039;s in wide use today, and I certainly hope all of us reading this write const-correct code.

Similarly, library writers can start writing noexcept in their libraries, and application developers can start writing noexcept, and retrofitting it slowly on existing code, and using it on their new code.  It could take a decade or two to be in mostly universal use, but C++ will presumably be used then.

The only problem I&#039;ve got with it is that it a whole lot of the library can&#039;t be noexcept.  If I resize or push_back on a vector, it might throw bad_alloc.

					<description><![CDATA[Can you elaborate on EDG position on &quot;export template&quot;.

From following a few threads on comp.std.c++ and comp.lang.c++.moderated, I had the impression that they actually were in favor of export, and felt that their position has been misrepresented. Daveed Vandervoode in particular came out several times specifically in defense of export, basing it on his experience of implementing it in EDG, and consequently using it.

					<description><![CDATA[Exceptions have zero run time overhead if they are not thrown. Not a single extra instruction in the code path. Exception handling tables are built *statically* at compile time.

See this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/307610/how-do-exceptions-work-behind-the-scenes-in-c#307716

If noexcept is being added only for optimisation opportunities then there is no point whatsoever.

On GCC at least, exceptions *do* bulk up the code a little by adding exception handling tables, but I don&#039;t think making a function noexcept will remove the need for those tables entirely anyway, since exceptions can still happen *within* the function, just not be thrown outside of it. So as far as I can tell, the stuff about noexcept or throw() being an optimisation is just not true. I guess GCC developers would be better to ask though...

					<description><![CDATA[I think the main problem with a static noexcept (or any other type system extension) is the large existing body of C and C++ code written without it, and the need for new code to use the old code easily.

If you wanted to write a new static-noexcept function that called old code, and were confident that none of the called functions threw exceptions (but they weren&#039;t declared noexcept), you&#039;d have to basically put a try/catch(...) block around all the whole new function. That&#039;s a bit verbose, and might nullify the effect of the noexcept optimization in the first place. It also wouldn&#039;t work in constructors or destructors where a new class derived from, or had a member of, an old class type, because you can&#039;t suppress exceptions thrown during member initialization to satisfy the static noexcept checker.

It wouldn&#039;t surprise me if some compiler vendors offered warnings for statically detected noexcept violations, though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree, I don&#039;t see any real gain in `noexcept` over `throw()` if both are required to call `terminate()` upon exception.

Unless `noexcept` is required to be checked at compile time this is not an optimization.

Unfortunately I cannot find N3050 on the official JTC1/SC22/WG21 2010 mailings page at this time.

The thing `noexcept` has that `throw()` doesn&#039;t is the optional boolean to enable it: `noexcept(true)` and `noexcept(false)`. But, I feel that `throw()` could be augmented with this functionality: `throw(true)` and `throw(false)`.

Replace:
exception-specification:
   throw ( type-id-list opt )

with:
exception-specification:
   throw ( boolean-literal opt ) // perhaps not boolean-literal, perhaps convertible-to-boolean?
   throw ( type-id-list ) // deprecated

Personally I don&#039;t like the negative form of `noexcept`, for instance `noexcept(false)`. I would rather like to use a positive form: `maythrow(true)`, but that on the other hand would require to write `maythrow(false)` instead of just `noexcept`.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m kind of iffy on what the point of noexcept is, if it still has the underlying problem that throw() did, i.e. it doesn&#039;t cause the compiler to statically prevent exceptions being thrown. After all, that&#039;s what most people want from exceptions specifications...

Why don&#039;t you just mangle noexcept into the *type* of the function in the same way that *const* is in the type of the function?

Then noexcept functions can only call other noexcept functions, and any non-noexcept code that is called, must be surrounded by a catch(...). This would actually be *useful*.

Having noexcept that calls terminate is not an improvement over the existing throw() syntax. I find this argument that there would be some kind of compiler optimisation that takes advantage of it kind of vague.

After all, that&#8217;s what most people want from exceptions specifications&#8230;</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t you just mangle noexcept into the *type* of the function in the same way that *const* is in the type of the function?</p>
<p>Then noexcept functions can only call other noexcept functions, and any non-noexcept code that is called, must be surrounded by a catch(&#8230;). This would actually be *useful*.</p>
<p>Having noexcept that calls terminate is not an improvement over the existing throw() syntax. I find this argument that there would be some kind of compiler optimisation that takes advantage of it kind of vague. At least with how GCC does exceptions(<a href="http://www.codesourcery.com/public/cxx-abi/abi-eh.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.codesourcery.com/public/cxx-abi/abi-eh.html</a>) I don&#8217;t think this is possible. Maybe I am wrong.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[With any declaration of behavior, there&#039;s two ways to go.  First, the implementation can enforce it, perhaps at some cost.  The compiler can insert checks to call terminate() if an exception is thrown.  Second, the compiler can take it as optimization advice that the programmer is responsible for getting right, and compile the function with no regard for exceptions.  (Or it can go either way, depending on compile options.  Common Lisp type declarations are often treated this way.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It may be called C++11, but in my heart it will always be C++0xB.

Seriously, though, congrats.  So what&#039;s the plan after C++11 is officially standardized?  I guess concepts, decimal types, modules, and tr2 will all be released as individual TRs?  When writing about the removal of concepts from C++0x, Stroustrup seemed worried that the WG will lose some momentum when the standard is completed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You mentioned that there was not universal agreement between calling terminate() vs allowing undefined behavior if a noexcept promise was violated. Could you expand on what were the reasons for even considering undefined behavior to continue? Given noexcept is new, there isn&#039;t a problem of backward compatibility. So why then was undefined behavior being considered as an option?]]></description>
