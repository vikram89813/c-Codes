					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not really censorship since this isn&#039;t a public forum, it&#039;s Herb&#039;s personal website.  I wholeheartedly agree with Herb&#039;s actions and I think one of my posts was pulled!  I used the &#039;F&#039; word and on reflection it&#039;s clear that it doesn&#039;t add anything to the state of the world to do so.

Thanks Herb!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I went back to delete all comments that contained pejorative wording like &quot;freetard,&quot; that unfortunately included comments that made potentially reasonable points but then ruined themselves by including attacks like &#039;what [X] said in his comment is just crap&#039; or &#039;the goal is to provide lifetime employment for people who [X].&#039; I could have just edited each such comment to remove the pejorative part, but felt that editing would be worse than approving/rejecting the entire comment as written, which is as the author intended it to be read.

Sorry for losing some potentially reasonable content in the same comment as an attack, but here&#039;s the deal: If a point is worth making, it&#039;s worth making respectfully.

If your comment was deleted, I encourage you to resubmit it without the inflammatory part. Thanks, again, for understanding.]]></description>
