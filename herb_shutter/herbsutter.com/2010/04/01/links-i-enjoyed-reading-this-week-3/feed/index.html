					<description><![CDATA[Yes, I have one of those. It&#039;s not quite as nice as a real stylus -- bigger tip, have to push hard, not quite as accurate. It&#039;s more of a stiff finger than a pen. And the killer is that applications aren&#039;t built to consider or exploit stylus support because the stylus isn&#039;t a standard part of the system (even though it&#039;s sold in Apple stores as a semi-popular third-party add-on). I really want a stylus + OneNote (specifically including &quot;ink&quot; support).]]></description>
