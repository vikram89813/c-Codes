					<description><![CDATA[Why would the standard not allow zero length stack based arrays?  This completely breaks my design.

struct Validator {
  int location;
  char contents;
};

static const Validator VALID[] = 
{
  {0, {&#039;a&#039;, &#039;b&#039;, &#039;c&#039;}},
  {3, {&#039;d&#039;, &#039;e&#039;}},
  {6, {}},
  {7, {&#039;v&#039;, &#039;w&#039;, &#039;x&#039;, &#039;y&#039;, &#039;z&#039;}},
};

template inline size_t ARRAY_SIZE(const T (&#038;array)[N])
{
  return N;
}

int main(int, char**) {
  for (int i = 0; i &#060; ARRAY_SIZE(VALID); i++) 
  {
    cout &#060;&#060; &#034;The Contents at location &#034; &#060;&#060; VALID[i].location &#060;&#060; &#034; are:&#034;;
    for (int j = 0; j &#060; ARRAY_SIZE(VALID[i].contents; j++)
    {
      cout &#060;&#060; VALID[i].contents[j] &#060;&#060; &#034;, &#034;;
    }
    cout &#060;&#060; endl;
  }
}

There are good scenarios where you would want 0 length stack based arrays.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You can safely do (A+N), but theoretically, i think there are problems with &#038;A[N] because A[N] is evaluated as an lvalue but it isn&#039;t guaranteed to refer to an object. But &quot;An lvalue refers to an object or function.&quot; and there is no &quot;empty lvalue&quot;. If C++ had a rule like C that says in a &#038;*X, the *X expression isn&#039;t evaluated (like in a sizeof, where *(int*)0 of course is perfectly legal), this would be different.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062; AFAIK, you can’t do it with an actual array of size 0 either.

You should be able to, since the Standard specifically allows to have a pointer one past the end of an array. I.e. for an array A of N elements, &#038;A[N] is valid, even though dereferencing it is not. I don&#039;t see why it should suddenly be invalid for N=0.]]></description>

If you really want to write that memcpy line, you should do:

					<description><![CDATA[Does this also apply to a vector of size 0?  So, for example is this code correct if the vector is empty?

    memcpy(pDest, &#038;vec[0], vec.size());

VC++ throws an SEH if checked iterators are turned on.  It makes code more cumbersome by having to check the size of vec before dereferencing it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the explanation. I&#039;ve happened to used zero-length array before. It compiled(with VC++) and worked. So I never thought it could fail until I read this blog. 

Now I recall that it was used something like this way, 
void f(size_t n)
{
  boost::shared_array si(new int[n]); 
//...
}

It feels good that you realize you safely passed an edge only afterwards.]]></description>
