					<description><![CDATA[I like your final point about how optimizations/performance will eventually become really important again. I think it may happen way sooner than the end of Moore&#039;s law though! Almdahl&#039;s law is a performance wall that&#039;s approaching faster than the end of Moore&#039;s law, so I think by the time we have to worry about Moore&#039;s law ending we will be well beyond the &quot;who cares about performance, computers are fast!&quot; attitudes of some current languages.

I wrote up a short blog post about this here: http://sebastiansylvan.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!4469F26E93033B8C!175.entry]]></description>
