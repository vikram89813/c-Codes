					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb,

I feel very, very stupid! Turns out I was using firefox and I had it configured to block images from i.cmpnet.com (probably because some other site threw banners at me from that domain?). I apologise for the false alarm, but the good news is now I can sit back and enjoy your new column in all its glory. Thanks for answering!

Kind regards,
Benjamin]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Benjamin: I see all the tables/figures, including this article (just checked it again). Can you give examples of ones you don&#039;t see?

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your monthly columns, I read them with great interest! Anyway, I notice that the dr dobbs site does not include any tables/figures that you reference in your article. 

This means I have to wait for the Dr Dobbs Digest PDF that they mail out once a month, is this intentional?]]></description>
