EDG didn&#039;t already support C++/CLI syntax, so one of the things on our to-do list is to add that. It probably won&#039;t be in time for this release, but it&#039;s on the list.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks - that makes sense.

Is the plan eventually (i.e. in v.next) to replace the front-end in the compiler with EDG as well? 

If so will EDG be supported to support microsoft extensions (such as C++ / CLI etc.)?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sunil: It&#039;s exactly what I meant, but at that time I couldn&#039;t say that the new front-end was EDG.

Note that EDG is the new front-end for Intellisense only in VS 2010, which has made Intellisense more accurate and faster. The compiler that compiles your code is still the same compiler, plus new features of course.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1) Profiling is not available in Beta1. :-(
2) tools-&#062;options-&#062;vc++ directories are now removed - use property page instead :-) msbuild is for sure promising.
3) compiling time is reduced (i have not tested it yet, but that is what it looks like)
4) IntelliSense still not working with boost/huge templates... 

Thank you, MS for perfect ppl/agents library!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pingpong: Yes, that&#039;s already been fixed. Hello world does of course compile in general, but you&#039;re right that in the IDE the default settings for a new C++ project should be to a mode that allows plain main() instead of expecting a nonstandard Unicode flavor. We&#039;ve fixed this so that in the next beta main() will be picked as the entry point if it exists.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Also included in VS2010 (and included in this beta release) are significant extensions to Dotfuscator CE that permit 
* the injection of feature and session monitoring (streaming usage data to a developer-specified endpoint), 
* the injection of application expiry dates, and 
* the injection of tamper defense and notification. 

Opt-in/Opt-out logic can also be injected.

Microsoft first announced this functionality at PDC2008
