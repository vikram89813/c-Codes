					<description><![CDATA[It appears that the &#039;performance analyzer tool&#039;  that could measure CPI and Cache miss rate provided critical clues to help find the cause.

Can you tell us which tool you used ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The final example in &quot;Eliminate False Sharing&quot; is a little unclear on the intent. The text says &quot;we arbitrarily force half the workers to only perform reads from their result[p]&quot; but it appears the code does a read on about half the threads when an element in the matrix is odd (good) and a read and write, &quot;++result[p]&quot;, for every thread when an element in the matrix is even (doh).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a problem with C# sample class. Runtime does not allow you to instantiate generic type with explicit layout.

If type is not generic everything works fine, e.g

[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit, Size = 2 * CACHE_LINE_SIZE)]
    public struct CacheLineStorage
    {
        const int CACHE_LINE_SIZE = 512;

        [FieldOffset(CACHE_LINE_SIZE)]
        public int data;
    }
CacheLineStorage test = default(CacheLineStorage);
int size = Marshal.SizeOf(test);

Size var will be equal to 1024.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rob: No, we didn&#039;t mean to say that.

Henrik: Thanks to Intel for their 4-proc x 6-core test machine. :-)

Ghita: Thanks. The article uses C++0x lambda syntax, which will be in Visual C++ 2010 (whose beta just went live incidentally, maybe I should blog about that [edit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://herbsutter.wordpress.com/2009/05/20/vs2010-beta-1-now-available/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ok, here it is&lt;/a&gt;]). You can do similar things in C# lambda syntax. In C or Java or a C++ implementation that doesn&#039;t support lambdas, just write an out-of-line helper function or Runnable class or functor, respectively (they&#039;re pretty much the same thing).

Michael: There have been experiments about automatically detecting false sharing and adding padding to remove the contention, particularly in managed environments that have more latitude to play with layout. But it&#039;s problematic so far and I don&#039;t know of a real-world product that can do this automatically. Does anyone else know of one?

Pizer: Excellent point. Score +1 bug report. I&#039;ll see if they can fix it on the website, but it&#039;ll be fixed in the book. The problem didn&#039;t arise in my testing version because the test code was a little different.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb,
  
   Is there an effort to do the padding at runtime automatically to avoid false sharing?  If no, why not?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very nice article Herb. One of the best ones !
Does the example written (using lambda) run in a current C# language/library release or do we need to use Visual Studio CTP ? Because in case we have to use CTP we will not be able to use so many cores on virtual PC...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb,
in your article you mention new standard C++
attribute syntax, [[align(32)]],
but I&#039;ve heard that Microsoft is refusing to implement it.
Could You comment on this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb,

Just a quick note to say thank you for all your great articles.  They have been enlightening for me in my work and I typically share them with the Drizzle contributor community as required reading.  Thanks, and keep up the great work!
