					<description><![CDATA[It also looks like all the asterisks in the type names are missing.  e.g., I assume &quot;LongHelper helper_ = nullptr&quot; should be &quot;LongHelper * helper_ = nullptr&quot;.  (I&#039;m assuming this isn&#039;t a change in C++0x that I&#039;ve missed.)

Thanks for the great articles. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Neilhendo: Thanks for the heads-up that stuff got unusually garbled this time. How strange.

Here&#039;s the forensic report: The extraneous &quot;do&quot;, &quot;3(a)&quot;, and &quot;sitaution&quot; are my own typos in the original manuscript. The missing &quot;)&quot; crept in during copyediting of the PDF magazine-style layout that goes to subscribers and I didn&#039;t notice they dropped it when I reviewed the proofs. The rest somehow crept in after that when they used the PDF draft to create the online version. I&#039;ll ask them to fix it. Thanks again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some more small typos (couldn&#039;t find a way to edit my previous post):

Example 1(a):

Missing &quot;)&quot; from this line:

if( helper == nullptr


I think &quot;start+&quot; should be &quot;start+i&quot; in this line:

for( ; i &#060; ChunkSize &#038;&#038; start+ &#060; items.size(); ++i ) {


Example 2(b):

helper- 1 ) do {


Also in the second Example 3(a) - should that be 3(b)?

while( n-- &#062; 0 ) do {


(Unless I&#039;m missing some while syntax changes in C++0x?)


On p.4:

&quot;sitaution&quot; in:

&quot;In that kind of sitaution, beware the possibility of starvation.&quot;


Hope that doesn&#039;t seem nit-picky... just figured you&#039;d want to know.  :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks - great and useful as always.  Looks like a small typo in the &quot;Example: Breaking Up a Potentially Long-Running Operation&quot; on the first page:

helper-&#060;render( items[i] );]]></description>
