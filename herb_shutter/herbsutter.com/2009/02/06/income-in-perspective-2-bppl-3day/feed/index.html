					<description><![CDATA[A can of soda might not be a good comparison. If you take the more &quot;fundamental&quot; products - bread, milk, fruits &#038; vegetables - that sort of thing, then you&#039;ll quickly notice that they are much cheaper, and not of any worse quality than in the West (in fact, for many agrarian countries, they are often better).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This represents the very tip of the iceberg in terms of the vastly different way people experience their existence in the world.  I suspect that if you were to get to know people from the area, you might find the differences run deeper; that they even have a radically different way of thinking than you or I -- especially considering the highly systematized, scientific way  we tend to approach everything.

While Slumdog Millionaire was a fun film, I think the best way to try and understand our fellow beings is through reading, especially fiction.  A primary function of good novels is to educate our moral sensibilities by allowing us to experience life as someone else.  While we can never truly understand what life is like for another, I applaud the effort to at least recognize that the way we (rich westerners) live is not the only cultural idiom, nor is it necessarily ideal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb,
I understand your feelings. Forget about the difference between Wester world and the other countries in Asia and Africa. The problem with some countries like India is that, the gulf between the rich and the poor is vast and is increasing day-by-day. I recommend you watch the movie &quot;Slumdog Millionaire (2008)&quot;.

					<description><![CDATA[Although I won&#039;t claim there is no problem and everybody is as rich as they should be, I have to say it&#039;s a bit unfair to take a Western product and expect it to pop up in the middle of nowhere, who knows how far from the nearest production facility, and expect it to not only be cheaper than in its home country, but to be substantially cheaper in order to match the local price scales.

How expensive would Zambian local produce be if you&#039;d want to buy it in a specialty store in, say, Denver?

Stories like &quot;oh my god they only make five bucks a DAY&quot; always remind me of my extended stay in China, where it was trivial to have a full multi-course meal for 10 kuai, ie. 1 dollar and change (at the time).

That said, there&#039;s no doubt that most people in the West have no idea how filthy rich they really are.]]></description>
