					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for that, that&#039;s an interesting article.  

I wonder if the reverse is true to some extent - that some execs have trouble with the idea of implementing Agile development because it sounds too weak. 

&quot;If there are no deadlines/buglists how is anyone ever going to be pushed etc etc.?&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[Good article, and I agree that the generally positive and encouraging terms used in Agile generally do have some kind of subliminal effect on the team.

However that&#039;s always brought my attention to the word &#039;Backlog&#039;, as it seems to make people feel like they are continually behind and stands out as about the only negative term in this approach to development.
