					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb,

I&#039;ll be in Sweden in March and April, because I have to work in a C# project there. That&#039;s great news!

I&#039;ve read a new book published by Packt Publishing &quot;C# 2008 and 2005 Threaded Programming&quot;, by Gaston Hillar - http://www.amazon.com/2008-2005-Threaded-Programming-Beginners/dp/1847197108
The book is great for me, because I am a beginner.
Now, I can understand your posts and I can work harder to be a professional multicore programmer.

I hope to see you in Stockholm, Sweden.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb,

I&#039;d like to translate to russian some of your articles about concurrency and multithreading and post it to my blog, of course preserving all links to original materials (to your blog or ddj.com). 
Can I do this from &quot;copyright&quot; point of view?

Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not to complain since I&#039;m sure it worth it for many, but the price keeps me from attending unfortunately. Too bad, it would be nice to have some books signed :)]]></description>
