					<description><![CDATA[I suspect the line defining the first personal computer meeting those requirements is a bit fuzzy. I notice you say &quot;demonstrate&quot;, not &quot;ship&quot;, which would probably qualify a non-economically feasible prototype.

I&#039;d hazard a guess that the early HP programmable calculators (98xx series - early 1970&#039;s) would qualify as stand-alone personal computers (despite the &quot;calculator&quot; moniker), but somehow I think you&#039;re looking for something much earlier.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I see there&#039;s been some confusion about what I meant by &quot;personal computer.&quot; Note that I worded that bullet specifically:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The personal computer for dedicated individual use, that one person can have at their disposal all day long.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That wording intentionally rules out pre-timesharing computers like ENIAC and TX-0 that just happened to only be usable by one person at a time. They were clearly not individual property for the dedicated use of only one person.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Personal computer&quot; is such a biased term. One site claims the first was &quot;Simon&quot; from the 1950s. But it doesn&#039;t seem to have what Babbage called &quot;eating its own tail&quot;. It&#039;s more a programable calculator. If you include that, then there were likely mechanical computers as well.

Mouse is, of course, Engelbart, 1968.

By &quot;internetwork&quot; I assume that means between two different types of networks, and that it excludes voice, telegraph, and video. Then I&#039;ll guess ARPANET, October 29, 1969. There were, of course, other ways to do point-to-point connections before then.

&quot;Using internetworks for live collaboration&quot;. I was going to say Engelbart&#039;s Mother of All Demos showed that, but I&#039;m thrown off by the &quot;internetwork&quot; part. I think they had a dedicated line from San Francisco to the SRI office.

I&#039;m going to guess that Engelbart&#039;s NLS includes some of the other things you asked about, like multiple users editing the same document, with video support. Quoting Wikipedia: &quot;One of NLS&#039;s most revolutionary features, the Journal, was developed in 1970 by Australian computer engineer David A. Evans[1] as part of his doctoral thesis. The Journal was a primitive hypertext-based groupware program which can be seen as a predecessor (if not the direct ancestor) of all contemporary server software that supports collaborative document creation (like wikis). &quot;


Multics had a hierarchical file system, which is where Thompson got the idea from, for Unix. But there could have been systems before that.

&quot;Copy&#038;paste&quot; was from Larry Tesler. According to his resume, &quot;first implemented in Gypsy in 1974-75&quot;. But I seem to recall the Engelbart demo having some mechanism for that. Then to add &quot;with drag and drop&quot; of text ... no idea.

I don&#039;t know what &quot;Paper metaphor for word processing&quot; means. Is that TeX? Or do you mean WYSIWYG word processing? Or do you want: &quot;RUNOFF was the first computer text formatting program to see significant use. It was written in 1964 for the CTSS operating system by Jerome H. Saltzer in MAD assembler.&quot;?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#039;PC&#039; is a funny one. You can argue that the PC was about the economics it introduced, which drove everything else (and was the only really new thing). So, by that definition, you still have the Altair, or maybe the programmable calculators of the 70s. Otherwise, there were &#039;one user&#039; machines from day 1 (even the Analytic Engine if you want).]]></description>
