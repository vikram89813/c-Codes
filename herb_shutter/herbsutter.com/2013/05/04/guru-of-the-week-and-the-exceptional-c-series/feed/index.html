					<description><![CDATA[@Rob:
&#062; The type is still there, albeit moved to the RHS; when you say “I always know the exact
&#062; type by looking at the right hand side of the assignment” does the same not apply with LHS
&#062; if you instead write the second example?

Well yes, but the emphasis was supposed to be on &quot;right hand side&quot; - I always want to know the type by looking at the RHS. It really helps me when switching a lot between different languages, which I have to do many times a day (Javascript, PHP, Ruby, Python etc.).

I have to agree that I found myself using auto a lot more than I thought I would - especially when dealing with iterators it saves so much time and I found myself to write better code thanks to having less of a penalty in time and effort when &quot;doing things right&quot;.

One more note on one of your examples:

auto iter = std::find_if( vertexRange.begin(), vertexRange.end(), []( const vertex&#038; v ) { … } );

I think in C++11 the preferred way of doing this is to use std::begin/std::end:

auto iter = std::find_if(std::begin(vertexRange), std::end(vertexRange), []( const vertex&#038; v ) { … } );

In that specific example, like the general use of auto for local variables, pretty much a matter of style and taste. But after all C++ is the language of options, isn&#039;t it? ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Michael I can only speak for myself, not Herb, but I don&#039;t feel any benefit from your example:
    auto s1 = std::string(“We can do this to avoid const char*”);

The type is still there, albeit moved to the RHS; when you say &quot;I always know the exact type by looking at the right hand side of the assignment&quot; does the same not apply with LHS if you instead write the second example?
    std::string s1 = “…”;

My own use of `auto` has, despite early reservations, proliferated to any situation where the type can be inferred without loss of clarity:
    auto vertexRange = boost::vertices( graph );
    auto iter = std::find_if( vertexRange.begin(), vertexRange.end(), []( const vertex&#038; v ) { ... } );
    auto foo = std::make_shared( 42 );

Incidentally I also use it anywhere a member function defined out-of-line has a return type scoped to the class:
    template  typename foo::bar foo::get_bar() { ... }
    template  auto foo::get_bar() -&#062; bar { ... }]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Herb:

&#062; In addition, I’ve found that C++11/14 is changing my coding style, including my basic variable declaration style. I
&#062; now think auto should be used consistently to declare local variables, even when you want to commit to a
&#062; specific type(!) 

Are talking about code like this?

auto s1 = std::string(&quot;We can do this to avoid const char*&quot;);
auto s2 = std::string{&quot;or even that, still need to get used to the curly braces here&quot;};
auto s3 = std::string();
auto s4 = &quot;&quot;s; // C++14?

vs.

std::string s1 = &quot;...&quot;;
std::string s2 = &quot;...&quot;;
std::string s3;
std::string s4;

Just curious, since I found myself writing code like this in my fully C++11 enabled projects lately. It feels natural to me, since I always know the exact type by looking at the right hand side of the assignment. If I look at s3/s4 right after working on C++98 code I don&#039;t like it, while if I wrote Python code beforehand I do and appreciate how this states more explicitly that I want to create a default constructed std::string and store it in s3/s4.

On a different note, will the assignment to s4 actually be possible in C++14 (N3531)?

auto s4 = &quot;I&#039;m a std::string&quot;s;
std::cout &#060;&#060; s4 &#060;&#060; &#034; is &#034; &#060;&#060; s4.length() &#060;&#060; &#034; chars long&#034; &#060;&#060; std::endl;

Trip reports seem to suggest that it has been voted into the standard.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Re old vs. new: I want to replace existing public GotWs, not maintain two versions side by side, for several reasons:

1. C++11 today, and C++14 very soon, *is* C++. GotW has always been about &quot;current&quot; C++, initially documenting the then-draft standard and tracking its changes (e.g., GotW #25 on auto_ptr was posted just before the meeting we knew auto_ptr would change, and the solution posted immediately after as the first documentation of the decision). I want to continue teaching current C++, and avoid disseminating dated material.

2. I want to avoid ambiguity, to preempt questions of the form &quot;is this the &#039;real/current&#039; Gotw #xyz?&quot; This was already a (minor) issue with the original public GotWs, because most of those were at least a little bit revised and expanded for the books, so the current version was actually in the books. This already caused some confusion when people saw the original GotWs and sent me comments already addressed in the updated book versions. I can imagine the same happening, only far more, with &quot;original C++98 and revised C++14&quot; versions of the same GotW floating around.

So as I publish each revised GotW here, my plan is to leave the original one&#039;s URL in place but replace it with a redirect to the current version of that same GotW. That will avoid two problems -- people learning &quot;old C++&quot; material which I think is actively undesirable, and having &quot;two current GotW #nnn&quot; that I&#039;ll have to disambiguate -- as well as help me migrate to a unified site here without breaking links, which is important. (The current GotWs are on my old site, gotw.ca, which I&#039;ve been meaning to migrate here for a few years, and this gives me the opportunity to gradually do that.)

---

@JohnH: I won&#039;t suggest people abuse &#039;auto&#039;. And I realize it&#039;s a lightning-rod/bike-shed; witness the perennial debates about the same feature in other languages. Please withhold judgment until you see the presentation, then see if you find (all or just parts of) it are convincing. You might be convinced to try auto more, if not universally. I was.

@nosenseetal: Well, C++11 and C++14 aren&#039;t numbered as versions, just as publication years. And backward compatibility is nearly perfect -- it&#039;s just that there are better/simpler ways now in addition to the existing ones that still work just as well as they always have.

@KCP, @EbilPhish: Yes, I&#039;ll fold those in relatively early into the single sequence. I took them down because I didn&#039;t want to cause needless confusion with their odd temporary numbering and different formatting.

@Motti Lanzkron: Yes, &#039;operator auto&#039; is being discussed this summer and there might be a paper. I might care about it enough to write it. :)

@Ninja: Yeah, I still need to work on Effective Concurrency. No ETA, sorry. Writing is unpredictable when you have a day job. Writing individual book Items in the form of GotWs or magazine articles happens when I can make evening/weekend time and get inspired, and assembling and revising them as a book happens when I can make a bigger block of weekend/vacation time and get on a roll. That drives my editor batty too, because booksellers like to have lots of predictable lead notice, and often will advertise &quot;coming&quot; dates when you made the mistake of mentioning a &#039;potential estimate&#039;. Exceptional C++ Style and C++ Coding Standards had all their original articles written awaiting assembly and revision, and suddenly came together when I happened to have a month of relative downtime (both times it was in a December vacation) and could shut myself in and finish assembling and polishing them, so the end result was we went from &quot;I don&#039;t know when I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;m busy, leamme &#039;lone&quot; to &quot;oh by the way it&#039;s done, here&#039;s the final camera-ready PDF attached, got a spare copyeditor to look at it before you send it to the printer&#039;s?&quot; in a few weeks. (I did let him know what was happening, so it wasn&#039;t quite that exciting, but it was pretty fast.) All I can say is that essentially all the material for Effective Concurrency is already written as published articles, and they&#039;re still current because they&#039;re language-agnostic, so the question is mostly when the assembly and polishing block of time can appear. Clearly I&#039;m putting XC++ first though, at least for now. :)]]></description>

Exceptional C++ Style and C++ Coding Standards had all their original articles written awaiting assembly and revision, and suddenly came together when I happened to have a month of relative downtime (both times it was in a December vacation) and could shut myself in and finish assembling and polishing them, so the end result was we went from &#8220;I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ll be done, I&#8217;m busy, leamme &#8216;lone&#8221; to &#8220;oh by the way it&#8217;s done, here&#8217;s the final camera-ready PDF attached, got a spare copyeditor to look at it before you send it to the printer&#8217;s?&#8221; in a few weeks. (I did let him know what was happening, so it wasn&#8217;t quite that exciting, but it was pretty fast.) All I can say is that essentially all the material for Effective Concurrency is already written as published articles, and they&#8217;re still current because they&#8217;re language-agnostic, so the question is mostly when the assembly and polishing block of time can appear. Clearly I&#8217;m putting XC++ first though, at least for now. :)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[That is really good to hear. Though I suggest to keep the old pages also accessible (like a link at the solution opening the archived version, if they can&#039;t be melt) for those still using old compilers. Or new ones that lagged behind with some of those features.

It would also serve as comparison, to show side by side the advance of the language, and reflect the old ways that can be left behind.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great news! One thing comes to mind though. I know GotW is a well-known brand/trademark of sorts, but I can see problems ahead, trying to figure out wether this is this or this is that, i.e. the same name GotW#n but two completely different apples. Ok, one quick scan looking for auto would be enough to pick the fresh apple but what if I&#039;m an crazy enough person and like to eat apples in the dark...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wonderful news. The updates to these books are sorely needed, in particular as many organisations lean on them heavily for their internal coding standards. I ran into this very problem this week as I scrabbled around grepping the web to be able to quote &#039;What does Herb recommend *now*’ during a code review.

&#039;Multiple compilers&#039; will implement C++ 14 by the end of next year? Cool, I sincerely hope that includes MSVC! Here&#039;s hoping you have some pleasant news for us at BUILD 2013. In the meantime can I add my voice to the chorus of thanks for continuing efforts in helping to shepherd C++ and its community Herb. Major kudos.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;he handful of GotWs I wrote last year will be renumbered as they’re folded into the original series, either as updates or with new numbers in the original sequence if they’re on completely new topics. &quot;
Backward compatibility =  gone :P    btw this C++11/14 is a bit like a joke.../ PR (like diff between AES128/256) it is more like C++11/11.01 
Other than that cool to hear you have find time to do new/ refresh GotW entries... they are pretty much classic C++ material. :)]]></description>
