					<description><![CDATA[self documentation vs auto.
In example 2. 
[code]
unique_ptr&#060;widget&#062; load_widget( widget::id desired );
[/code]
You get self documentation---you can see in the code that you get control over widget.

Once you use auto 
[code]
// Accept as a unique_ptr (by default)
auto up = load_widget(1);
[/code]
we have to look up the signature of load_widget...it is no longer documented in the call. 

This seems to be a subtle trade off here. Any thoughts?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The fact that unique_ptr forces to know the destructor of the object forces to expose the class definition at each level (which is not the case with raw pointer, neither with shared_ptr), even when passing the unique_ptr through different layers. As a consequence that each time the class definition changes, it will imply the recompilation of those intermediate layers even if they do not really use the object. This tends to brake the usage of unique_ptr with factory.
Any comment about this ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Kai: Definitely not recommending smart pointers for everything, in particular not for most parameters; see GotW #91.

But overall tool support is an interesting question. I view it like other features such as template mangling or generating lambda function objects. The features are good for clarity and correctness, should be recommended, and will be used. Many C++ code bases have long routinely used custom nonstandard smart pointers already anyway. If sometimes a tool&#039;s implementations has scalability trouble with a popular feature, if it causes a real problem then the tool needs to be improved. (However, for balance, there have been one or two complexity-inducing C++ features that caused tool trouble where it wasn&#039;t fair to blame the tools, but we don&#039;t have export any more and that was the main one.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure recommending unique_ptr et al for every pointer out there is a good idea, because it will blow up debug symbol sizes. I did a quick test and replaced the pimpl pointer of an otherwise empty class with unique_ptr - for clang 3.2 that adds 30 additional debugging symbols to the .o file, for gcc 4.8 it&#039;s even 60 (!). I can easily imagine this kills debugging performance in larger projects ...

					<description><![CDATA[The advantage of having a wrapper unonwned_ptr template type is purely for self documentation. When I see T* I have to ask myself whether the person who wrote this thought about ownership and decided that a raw pointer is the correct way to go or whether (for some code bases the more probable reason) the original author was just lazy/incompetent (often the original author is myself but that doesn&#039;t rule out incompetence...).

After looking though the code I came to the conclusion that a raw pointer is the correct choice but tomorrow someone else will see the same code and wonder the same thing and have to duplicate the work of understanding  the correct semantics for this pointer.

					<description><![CDATA[I understand the difference between empty and null. I am just wondering, in the context of factories, when returning a verctor of things, what is the benefit of returning a null value. How is it a better solution that returning an empty vector? Also, as currently implemented, it looks like your example 4(c) always returns a valid vector, that can be empty but not null.

I have mitigated feelings about optional. I find that sometimes it is an easy solution but not a good solution. I would be very interrested in a post discussing when to use it and when to not use it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Johannes and @Herb: This is the first time that I think I understand when to write &#039;return move&#039;. But I think that this has nothing to do with copy elision in contrast to what Johannes is saying. In the following code
[code]
optional&#060;vector&#060;gadget&#062;&#062; load_gadgets() noexcept {
    vector&#060;gadget&#062; ret;
    // ... populate ret ...
    return move(ret);   // important: move() here to avoid a silent copy
}
[/code]
ret is implicitely converted to optional&#060;vector&#062; by one of the following converting constructors of optional: constexpr optional(const T&#038;) or constexpr optional(T&#038;&#038;) depending whether you write return ret; (for the former) or return move(ret); (for the latter). The result of this coversion is a temporary object, which is copied/moved into the function&#039;s return value. An implementation is allowed to elide this last copy/move. Please correct me if I got it wrong.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In question 4 I think you should be talking about vector. It makes it irrelevant to compare it with the polymorphic type widget. By that I mean of course you can return by value a vector because it is heap based. 

But the question remains to be answer, would you return a widget by value if it is not a polymorphic type. The function should probably be changed to create instead of load because there is no failure possible when you return by value. But still let take a common class, a mammoth class, not something small like a Matrix4x4, but something with bad design that does too much things and has plenty of states, bools, floats,..... I would still think twice to return that by value. It might not be call often in that case well you need to decide if you pay the price. I am just saying that this is probably more what should have been the answer to number 4 and have an other question or a note for cheap moveable type like vector.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When the return type of the function is &quot;optional&quot; and you are returning a local variable of type &quot;T&quot;, NRVO doesn&#039;t apply. I think that means you should explicitly move &quot;vector&quot; it in that case, because the implicit move-treatment is based on the possibility of being able to do NRVO, or has that rule changed for C++14?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Repeating my comment I also made on the #89 solution: BTW, the reason I’m posting #89 to #91 in faster succession is because we already saw versions of these exactly one year ago, as then-numbered #103 to #105, so some of the comment discussion about them would be duplicated and I also wanted to get more quickly to the solution for the third which I didn’t post last year. I think you’ll see that all three have been considerably updated since the initial three questions and two solutions I posted a year ago — and not just because of make_unique, and its corollary don’t-write-new, but also some other C++14-isms including the brand-new optional which, like make_unique, has only been in the draft standard since last month.]]></description>
