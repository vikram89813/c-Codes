					<description><![CDATA[Joe - It&#039;s always a problem when the standard keeps changing and for little benefit ( for the majority of users). The more complex / extended the standard becomes the longer it will take for it to be supported, if at all! The standards people are not helping c++ but actually hurting it as a universal language. In addition, the more complex you make a language the more likely you are to see broken compilers or &#039;deviant&#039; behaviour...... The last thing we need!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I echo the concerns raised earlier about Microsoft&#039;s compiler. The C++14 standard will be out long before Visual Studio supports C++11, and I wouldn&#039;t be in the least bit surprised if C++17 standardisation predates C++11 support in cl.

It&#039;s a sad state of affairs - the 2005 and 2008 releases were excellent C++03 compilers (even 2003 wasn&#039;t bad) and for a while Microsoft did really seem to be treating C++ as a first class language.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sadly, I have to add my voice to those of Glen and Martin.

While both Clang (http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html) and GCC (http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html) support practically all of the C++11 standard, MSVC keeps lagging behind.

When I heard that Herb was hired by Microsoft and that they are prioritizing C++, I had high hopes but so far I&#039;m disappointed.

So what use is to talk about C++14 if we still cannot use all the C++11 features in 2013?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Brian m

What divergence are you referring to, is it VLA&#039;s being a subset in C++11 from the C kind? If so, I think the C++ team have the better answer. My take on that is that in time the C team will follow suit and deprecate their additional unfortunate early choices. Personally I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d have voted in VLA&#039;s at all. But that would have left more divergence, not less, if that&#039;s what you meant at all. So do elaborate, I&#039;m keen to hear. There&#039;s no point in criticizing without being specific. It also shows how hard it is to please all the people.

I agree that a &quot;simplified&quot; C++ sounds good. If you have concrete proposals on what that means, do elaborate on that too and debate them on isocpp.org too, that&#039;s what it&#039;s for.

I&#039;d like to congratulate the C++ committee for their hard work. I like a lot of what I see. I&#039;m sure there&#039;ll be things I don&#039;t like too (VLA&#039;s being one), but until I&#039;m clear enough about what that is I&#039;ll keep quiet and even then since I didn&#039;t object earlier, I&#039;ll accept that such criticism might be a bit rich....

Congratulations again to everybody for their hard work. I&#039;m very excited about C++, from the C++14 ideas to the isocpp.org website and Concepts Light. Let&#039;s be a little grateful. Things were looking a lot worse a year or two ago.

I&#039;m totally jazzed about the C++14 features so far.

Now Herb, lets talk about the C++11 features missing from Visual Studio. When can we expect an update on that and what will be in / out?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just what c++ needed more complication and divergence! The only thing of use is the teaser about better diagnostics.
What is required is a simplified c++ with some core features.  c++/STL is now rapidly becoming a 80:20 language, 80% of users use only 20% of the features. The standards people need to get out there and see what really is being used or maybe I&#039;m getting too cynical, but is it more about training opportunities for them - money!]]></description>
