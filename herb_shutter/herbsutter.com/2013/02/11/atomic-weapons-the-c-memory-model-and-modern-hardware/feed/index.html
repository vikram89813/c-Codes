					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb,
First of all, thank you for the great talk and for making it available online.
A section of the slides that you couldn&#039;t cover in the talk was that on the Double-Checked locking pattern (pages 53-56). More specifically, I have a question on page 54, where you propose to use: 
if (!create.exchange_explicit(true, memory_order_relaxed)) {...}
In my opionion, this should be fine based on the standard&#039;s 29.3/12 (&quot;Atomic RMW operations shall always read the last value (in the modification order) written before the write associated with the RMW operation&quot;).
But you wrote on the second slide, as the answer to the initial question: &quot;No; e.g. could do some widget creation even if CAS fails - and worse&quot;.
This doesn&#039;t look accurate to me, as you are using a plain exchange() and not a compare_exchange_weak(); note the standard allows only the latter to fail.
Am I misinterpreting your proposed implementation?
PS I&#039;m assuming this code should be able to run in either a weak or strong hardware memory model]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb, do you have any C/C++ code examples that illustrate how the new lrda and strl in ARMv8 are advantageous over x86? I am looking for a few practical illustrations /exercises for students who might run code on an ARMv8 simulator or board vs their x86 laptop. Thank you, Jim]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Could I ask for some clarification? In the &quot;relaxed&quot; section of the talk, you have a &quot;stop&quot; variable and a relaxed load from it to check whether a thread should end, paired with an SC store &quot;stop = true;&quot; in the main thread. Is it actually guaranteed that the store operation propagates and becomes visible eventually? Would such a guarantee depend on the existence of an acquire-release-pair? (I appreciate that actual synchronization isn&#039;t required in the example and that we don&#039;t need a release sequence, but I don&#039;t see how eventual propagation is guaranteed.)

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@peeterjoot: Yes, the instruction sequences shown are for directly mapping each atomic operation in the source in isolation conservatively, so that it&#039;s correct no matter what else is going on nearby. That&#039;s a correct baseline code generation strategy, and often sufficient. If your optimizer can see more of what&#039;s going on in the surrounding context, however, it can further refine the code generation. The example you give is one such case. See also the POWER code gen slide on page 37 of the handouts, where it notes &quot;you can almost get away with an lwsync here&quot; (you can indeed get away with it if you little more about other nearby atomic loads and stores in the same thread).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First off.  Excellent presentation(s)!  I&#039;d loved to have had this available ten years ago when I was first blundering through these concepts.  I&#039;ve done similar ones for our internal developers, but liked what you did much better!

In the second presentation, you aren&#039;t using lwsync for PowerPc, instead are using the heavyweight sync, which is what we&#039;ve used in our code (for example mutex implementation) since it was available.  Is this because you want the MM to default to not allowing a rel/acq to be reordered?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really liked the talk Herb, I think I get pretty much everything a lot better than before, but I&#039;m a bit confused about this now: 
all the positive ordering effects of atomics are introduced in part 1 in terms of how Acquire/Release form the packaged deal that guarantees the induction of a &quot;happens-before&quot; relationship. 
But the default memory ordering for atomic operation is std::memory_order_seq_cst (as further explained in part 2), right? So, aren&#039;t all things introduced in part 1 (related to Acquire/Release) more specific for the cases where you request a std::memory_order_acquire, std::memory_order_release or std::memory_order_acq_rel? 
IOW: if using default memory order for atomics, aren&#039;t all the things explained in part 1 &quot;over-guaranteed&quot; because the default std::memory_order_seq_cst is the strongest and hence does all that Acquire/Release do and more? I&#039;m asking this because after looking at part 1, I got the idea that I reading atomics would use std::memory_order_acquire and writing them would use std::memory_order_release, which I knew wasn&#039;t true and which you confirm it&#039;s not true in part 2, the default being std::memory_order_seq_cst... 
Hope I was able to explain my doubt... 

Thanks,
Andrea.]]></description>
