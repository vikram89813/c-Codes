					<description><![CDATA[Is there any way to get all 33 concurrency articles short of signing up for Dr. Dobbs (they limit how many articles unregistered users can view)? I have this kooky but handy policy of never signing up for something I don&#039;t foresee using again later (keeps my accounts manageable), but this would be one of those cases where said policy is something of an inconvenience to me...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What I have found useful, and much in line with what others have posted before me, are the following:

1) &quot;Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture Volume 2: Patterns for Concurrent and Networked Objects.&quot; For me, this book is analogous to the &quot;GoF&quot; book but for concurrency: it details the fundamental patterns and idioms folks use to build concurrent systems in the same format as “Gang of Four” Design Patterns book.

2) C++ Concurrency in Action.

3) &quot;Is Parallel Programming Hard, And, If So, What Can You Do About It?&quot; Edited by Paul E. McKenney. It is the most thorough discussion of modern issues and techniques that I have seen. You can find the updated versions on the web: ftp://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/perfbook/perfbook.html

I reckon it is obvious, but I read the mighty Herb Sutter too. 

Take care,
mike vitalo]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Design Patterns: &quot;Head First Design Patterns&quot; for getting into design patterns thinking. GoF book is the definitive authority. Gurus can skip the first book. The GoF book is outdated regarding C++11.

					<description><![CDATA[I would recommend Fowler&#039;s book &quot;Patterns of Enterprise application architecture&quot;.. It&#039;s a bit domain-specific (databases), but it stays very true to the spirit.

Also by Fowler, the &quot;Refactoring&quot; book was the first time I saw rewriting OO software as a sequence of testable, small atomic steps.  Helped me immensely.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Gang of Four book is definitely a classic, particularly as an academic study of design patterns, but I frankly got more value learning and understanding design patterns from Head First Design Patterns.

					<description><![CDATA[For concurrency I gained most reading the SPARC Architecture Manual http://www.amazon.com/SPARC-Architecture-Manual-Version9-International/dp/0130992275 especially details on relaxed memory models, the memory barriers and the assembly examples to create primitives like mutex, semaphore correctly.
And after that one can learn to do it with C++ from  C++ Concurrency in Action   http://www.amazon.com/C-Concurrency-Action-Practical-Multithreading/dp/1933988770  that explains both theory, the new C++11 features and even provides some useful global tips.]]></description>
