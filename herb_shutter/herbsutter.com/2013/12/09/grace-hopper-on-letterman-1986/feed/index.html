					<description><![CDATA[You are right! As to me, may it sound too harsh, behind too much jargon hides unprofessionalism. Introducing some technical terms cannot be avoided completely, though. When I used to work close with economists, accountants and financial directors (generally, people that far from writing code), I tried as much as possible to keep new definitions at the level 2-3 or under and for those tried to them like I was talking to a 5-year old boy. Not because they were stupid (they were not!), but rather domain-specific problems itself were had enough essential complications already.

BTW, when I was watching your big September&#039;s meeting, it happened that in the room was another person who was not related to technology and to programming particularly. After Bjarne&#039;s presentation she said that &quot;it is very down-to-earth&quot; to which I agree.]]></description>
