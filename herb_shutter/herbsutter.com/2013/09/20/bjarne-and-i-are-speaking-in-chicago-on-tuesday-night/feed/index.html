					<description><![CDATA[@GregM: Right.

					<description><![CDATA[@Yuriy Grishin: 
When using g++ you need to pass the -std=c++11 flag to compile c++11 code:
g++ test1.cpp -std=c++11
@Vipul S. Chawathe:
I presume the reason he calls it a ticking time bomb is the one stated in the files comment. The function he passes to f1(f) actually returns an int(although f1 expects it to return const int&#038;), yet the compiler does not even emit a warning(at least mine doesnt, g++ 4.8.1, even with -Wall -pedantic -Wextra, I have not tried clang ;_;). Instead it silently coerces and treats it as if it returned a const reference. Now, if i understand correctly, the very moment the wrapper is called, the returned value is treated as a reference, which is quite undefined behaviour and could lead to serious trouble.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed your talk on Tues Sept 24, and especially the English to C++ parallels, and would like to suggest some small fixes:
a) the ending -ize is indeed from Greek and is verbal; but the &quot;real&quot; in reali(s&#124;z)e is Latin; a better example might be bapti(s&#124;z)e, since bapt- is Greek.
b) the examples of the Persian and Roman empires were good; but you might want to look at (i) the Chinese empire (was Mandarin not the sole official language?) and (ii) the Islamic empire (I think more like the Persian empire, with one overarching privileged language, and many local languages of use).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, I saw those reports afterwards.

What is most baffling is the (unfortunately-as-usual) vacuous and even hateful comment threads. In the first couple of pages, I saw nothing but angry comments that people are making this up and should get a life.

As I mentioned in my talk on Tuesday night, my wife is a longtime satisfied iPhone user who is prone to motion sickness, and the gentler motion in iOS 6 and earlier never bothered her before. After installing iOS 7, she couldn&#039;t even unlock her phone without a wave of nausea -- the effect was immediate from the first unlock with iOS 7. And it isn&#039;t just the parallax wallpaper (which wasn&#039;t even enabled on her iPhone 4), it was the extra zoom motion everywhere but particularly on unlock, where the zoom animation was (a) slower and (b) irregular with different icons falling in at different speeds.

Calling people who report these problems &quot;stupid&quot; and claiming they&#039;re making it up and should &quot;grow a pair&quot; is just foolish, yet that&#039;s what every user comment I&#039;ve read so far has said. Now, I realize comment threads are usually 90% foolish, but this is the first comment thread that was 100% foolish (at least as far as I read it). Fortunately the commenters here are much better and well over 90% reasonable and thoughtful -- thanks! it&#039;s much appreciated.]]></description>
