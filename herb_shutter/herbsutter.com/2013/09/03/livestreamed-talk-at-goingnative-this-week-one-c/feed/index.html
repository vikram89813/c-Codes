					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb,

I noticed that on your 15 LOC simple C++ program slide you wrote approximately (from my lousy memory):

for (auto&#038; e: v)
   cout &#060;&#060; e;

wouldn&#039;t &#034;for (auto e: v)&#034; be more appropriate in that context?

					<description><![CDATA[Good morning Herb, 

I appreciate your posts on Sutter&#039;s Mill. 

In recent times I am having difficulty finding a consistent part of these emails to put in a mail rule so that all your posts go into a Sutter&#039;s Mill folder. 

Any suggestions? 

Many thanks,

					<description><![CDATA[NHF to Bjarne(Stepanov recently said in the interview that it is probably unique that person like that sticks to his project for so long time and respect for that) but his talks are for noobs, nothing wrong with that but I look much more to my 2 fav C++ ppl
: 
STL and Andrei, although I guess I already can guess what evils of rand()%100 are :) .
Don&#039;t get me wrong I will prob like and watch rest of the  talks including ofc Herbs(his CppAB talks were without making it sound fanboy like really influential in a sense it was not just about do dont do but also about how to use C++11 in a broader sense, though even specifics like concurrent of T were cool :) ), but STL and Andrei are like rock stars to me, except they are really cool and not fakes . :) 
Regarding C++14 - Im just happy that it is finally done so that we can get that juicy C++17 with real features, not just completed C++11. :) 
This is not to disrespect all the work of C++ committee - when I read the standard I wish Google translate  had standardese to English option :P  and when I don&#039;t understand anything about relaxed atomics I just imagine what alien wizards actually managed to wrote a specification for that. :) And also what kind of alien wizards actually design CPUs that make it all happen. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb

&quot;9:00am Seattle time on Wednesday &quot; 

Given that there will be participants from all over the world, may I suggest you add other times as well? at least GMT?
It&#039;s always painful to know what is the right time for a given time-zone.

Thanks
