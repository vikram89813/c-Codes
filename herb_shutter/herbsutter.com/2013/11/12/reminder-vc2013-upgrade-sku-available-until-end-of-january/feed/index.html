					<description><![CDATA[Herb,
I am trying to figure out the release plans for Visual Studio for my company, and am reduced to reading various blog posts by you and various bloggers at Microsoft, watching videos, and so on. It is quite frustrating. I am happy that Microsoft is reaching out to communicate, but it is very piecemeal, and hard to stitch together what the story is.

Here&#039;s my question. There has been talk about bug support in VS 2012 once 2013 rolled out. Best I can figure it, updates past update 4 will end for VS 2012, and most bug fixes will only be made to VS2013. If I recall, you made a comment *somewhere* (I can&#039;t find it to even confirm if it was you or not), that perhaps 3 line fixes could be rolled back into 2012. But then if I search around on the Microsoft website they claim support for many years to come; does support include bug fixes? 

This is extremely important to us because we work in an industry with extremely short turn around times (production TV). A stable compiler environment is worth a lot more than the latest C+11 feature for many of our projects (there are projects where the opposite is true). Keeping up to date with Visual Studio has a lot of implied costs for us. On the other hand, if we are going to be stuck with a buggy 2012 compiler, well, we will need to keep up with the latest release. To make this very clear, it has been declared that we will stay with 2012 for at least 2 years, and I need to know if this is a safe decision or risky one. 

Can you offer some insight into the bug/support issue with Visual Studio now that you are in this more rapid release cycle?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The pricing is predatory for non-US residents. For example for VS2013 Professional in Australia, US$499 becomes US$740 in Australia from the same servers and no sales tax. All Microsoft products are priced in this way.

To make it seem really dishonest the microsoft store is also geoblocked.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Concerned: I wouldn&#039;t call VC++ 2013 extremely buggy, YMMV -- I know of two slightly embarrassing bugs (each with dozens of duplicate reports covering overlapping cases but for the same underlying bug) but IME it&#039;s more solid overall than VC++ 2012. Yes, there will definitely be bug fixes in Updates and possibly other ways. No specific dates have been announced for those, but last cycle saw regular Updates and you should expect the same to be true this time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Herb: That sounds like a great offer and  I&#039;m sure many people would be thankful to MS for providing it.

That said, given the extreme buggy nature of the VS2013 C++ compiler and library - taking into account new features and the like, is there any official word from MS as to when we can expect the urgently awaited 2013 service pack or at least out of band update?

Or will we have to wait for a VS2014/VS2015 release for those issues to be resolved.]]></description>
