					<description><![CDATA[stanislavk - surely the point is that the bug arose from Java programmers programming in Java, not C++ programmers programming in C++. It might have been the latter, since Java is built on top of C++, but it wasn&#039;t. I think that point is worth making, and I don&#039;t see why it&#039;s unfair. It would be unfair to blame this Java bug on C++.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You forgot to mention that those vulnerabilities only affect Oracle&#039;s Java implementation, and to a certain extent the OpenJDK. There are many other Java runtimes out there from several vendors.

Unfortunately the normal public tends to mix language with implementation, so they think Oracle&#039;s Java means any Java implementation.

As for C and C++ vulnerabilities, those are usually on the languages themselves, because even expert programmers are prone to shot themselves on the foot when doing pointer and array manipulation, or dealing with null terminated strings.

C++ makes the situation better than C, but even in 2013 not everyone is allowed to use the standard C++ library on their projects.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thx for the post, Herb.  Although Java is a language and a platform, the important bits for me are that the solution is not in patching the underlying OS (libraries), rather in patching either the JVM or the Java libraries, or both.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, Java is not just a language, like C++, it&#039;s framework, which is pretty complicated. And its the particular implementation of that framework which has these bugs. So, at the first place, making such comparison is not fair. 

Another point is that the most of such framework bugs are related to sandbox, which is used to run applets and which is not used for any other purposes (of course some people can, but that&#039;s good way to shoot your own leg). It means that unless your app is an applet (about 99.999% of all java apps) you are not affected. 

Thanks for joke anyway.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One could surely say that now it is:
&quot;No time for Java&quot; :P
www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF0-LGoXtaw
BTW Herb IDK if you read comments, but you posted a link recently(feedback for new lambda syntax and nobody responded to isocpp.org comments. If you wanted ppl to post only on the mailing list you should have said to, this way it looks a bit rude. :D]]></description>
