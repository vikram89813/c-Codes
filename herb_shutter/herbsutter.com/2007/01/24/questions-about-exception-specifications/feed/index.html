					<description><![CDATA[I see why C++&#039;s exceptions are bad, and I&#039;ve experienced Java&#039;s, but in both cases it appears to me as if it&#039;s a case of trying to overuse the available and imperfect information.  I think Java&#039;s system might be great, if it was something you could demote to a warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are they just glorified documentation then?  Depends on how far you take that, but I think they are far more useful than an unstructured comment.  Besides which it&#039;s not if by chance someone finds the miraculous solution to strongly checked exceptions, those glorified comments might become even more useful (not crossing my fingers though).&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;div&gt;The issue isn&#039;t quite so cut and dried in Java as presented in this blog.  It seems that C++ exceptions truely do suffer from a flawed implementation, which reminds me of some of the issues with Java generics - problems because of the compromise approach the designers chose.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But in this blog is reiterated the typical, main argument against Java exceptions: too complicated for Java Joe.  That&#039;s what I call a punt.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here&#039;s some great reading (with some strong pro&#039;s and other weak con&#039;s, in addition to Java Joe&#039;s programming ability) on the subject, which advocates a more middle of the road approach.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
