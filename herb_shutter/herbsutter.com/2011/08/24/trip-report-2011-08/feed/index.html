					<description><![CDATA[@Derek: Go ahead and write a proposal for it. ;) (Probably along with a prototype implementation, of course)

The problem is that it&#039;s a huge task, it&#039;s really difficult to make something that&#039;s both usable and not platform-dependent.

I&#039;ve read on several occasions that Boost wouldn&#039;t mind having a GUI library. It&#039;s just that no one has offered to make one. Presumably the same for the standards committee. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“ASIO or thread pools, anyone? Maybe parallel algorithms, and concurrent containers?” I can get those from Boost. Know what I can&#039;t get from Boost?

*Modules*. Get on it. That&#039;s something that should have been worked out for C++0x, but it was pushed off thanks in part to Concepts. A feature that was culled due to the need to get the spec out on time.

Yes, library stuff is important. But not as important as getting the final rough spots of the language ironed out. What we need is some compiler developer to go and make modules actually work, implement them, and then advertise it as a unique feature. Then, you&#039;ll see how quickly it gets standardized when you cut compile times down by 2-3 orders of magnitude.]]></description>

Yes, please.  All of that ;).  Other good candidates: boost::variant and boost::optional.]]></description>
