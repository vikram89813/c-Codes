					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure if this particular instance is being recorded, though it might be (someone has already asked permission to do so). If it does get recorded and posted online, I&#039;ll blog about it here.

Note that a shortened version of this talk is already available online, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/6j5wnyg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;my earlier blog post&lt;/a&gt; (and use the &quot;updated link&quot; as I see it moved to be hosted on Channel 9&#039;s site). This is the version I gave at PDC, to a crowd that turned out to be heavy on C# developers, hence you&#039;ll notice a different spin as I&#039;m presenting it.]]></description>
