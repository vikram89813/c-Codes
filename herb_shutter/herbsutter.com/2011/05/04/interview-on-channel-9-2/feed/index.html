					<description><![CDATA[@Bobobobo:

Actually, we don&#039;t force Silverlight on you... We provide a number of different formats of our media posts. Just click on one of your liking in the Downloads list next to the offending inline player... The MP4s are h.264 and will run on most any OS (Windows.*, OSX, Linux.*, Android, iOS, WP7, etc...). 

Your assumption about C9 is incorrect. We are primarily in the business of showcasing Microsoft (and non-MS, too) people and the technologies they think up and write or build. This is at the core of what we do. Now, fairly, we do pimp products and technologies, too, but not for the most part...
