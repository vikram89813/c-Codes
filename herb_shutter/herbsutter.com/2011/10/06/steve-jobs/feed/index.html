					<description><![CDATA[I have thought a lot about Steve in the last few months, as I&#039;ve watched his company shine and his health fade.

He took a bite out of life as big as the one he left in his Apple.

I will miss his fight, his spirit, his ability, and his brashness - which somehow, I always found acceptable. More than that - enjoyable.

Maybe I liked that because I&#039;m dumb enough to have to say sorry sometimes; and he gave me chance to live vicariously through someone who wasn&#039;t and so didn&#039;t.

Steve fought and beat the estbalishment without somehow ever becoming defined by it.

The tech wave has been an amazing ride; and throughout it, Steve caught every wave of it before I even knew I was on it.

Did he catch those waves where I missed them? No, he made those waves where there were none.

He didn&#039;t just distort reality, he made it.

I have genuinely shed much tear for a man I never knew.

Steve didn&#039;t just get rich, he en-riched, and for that he will long remain an icon in my mind when all others have been deleted.

Herb, I envy you if you had the opportunity to meet the man; and I admire you for creating waves of your own too.

I am pleased you are in good health and that you continue to make waves.

I take the time now to thank you too for sharing them.

Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t understand why in so many posts, videos and articles about the passing of Steve Jobs I am seeing a lot of people that say his claim to fame was overrated.  Obviously there&#039;s no respect even in death, but the guy took something that was essentially going to be thrown out and, over the years, developed and marketed some of the most useful communication and computing technologies the world has ever known.  

If you don&#039;t think a life like his is a monumental loss, you&#039;re just being selfish.]]></description>
