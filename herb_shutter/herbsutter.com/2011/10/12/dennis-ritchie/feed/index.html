					<description><![CDATA[Respected Sir, I am not qualified to talk of FORTH simply because I do not know that language.I will accept your point as it is. The issue is not which is better ;the issue, I think , is whether DMR deserves this, this much, attention.Also when eulogising DMR no body takes away others&#039; importance. Is it expected of a DMR admirer to list everyone who preceded him and say, &quot; along with them I praise DMR&quot;? 

Let us praise Moore more! No problem.
And there are other things apart from portabilty.
All said and done, Sir, I praise those who Iknow and who I understand.My only request is &quot;Be positive&quot;.
( I think my response was to a referernce to PASCAL)

Thank you for point about FORTH.

					<description><![CDATA[Sir,
No body denies Pascal is good.But you  are clearly unaware of  the field of computer scince  and Application of Languages, as well as the broad spectrum of  variants of Hardware, even today; or atleast your knowledge is not deep enough to appreciate the nuances of this field.
Do not bother yourself about things you probably will never understand.

					<description><![CDATA[RIP Dennis ... your contributions to our world were immeasurable.

C is highly portable, that is beyond dispute, but it is not THE most portable language invented &quot;back then.&quot;

FORTH is even more portable, and is almost always the first high-level language ported to new hardware because of its simplicity. Its invention precedes C by about three years. (1970 vs 1973)

Furthermore, it along with LISP is its own operating system! FORTH can support ANYTHING that C can do as well. Charles Moore, the inventor of FORTH, was a contemporary of Dennis Ritchie too.

LISP too is an even more viable candidate for the title of the world&#039;s first portable operating system, and IT predates C and Unix by MORE THAN a decade.

Just as Steve Jobs was not the creator of the PC, an all-too-common myth being propagated too much lately, Dennis Ritchie was not the creator of the world&#039;s first portable operating system. He simply wasn&#039;t, and the popularity of the product does not make it so.]]></description>

No matter C or Unix, I see the truth of simplicity. The simplicity to make things consistent with the situation (hardware limitation and our needs) at the time and even till now. The simplicity to make people doing things more rather than asking or arguing more(this is what industry world respects, I think). C is not only portable and efficient among machines but also among us.

On the other hand, C is just a state of art, a realistic and successful practical one branched from the long term pursue in computation science.
