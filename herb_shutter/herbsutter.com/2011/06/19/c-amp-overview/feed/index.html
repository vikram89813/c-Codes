					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/07/01/go_v_cpluplus_redux/

This article caught my eye about how a Go program once further optimized finally yielded a version as fast as a comparable C++ program. Interestingly, the authors confessed that even then the C++ version was still more readable and used a lot less memory thanks to destructors etc. That&#039;s if I read the article correctly.

Who knew a C++ program could be more readable than anything?! :)

Anyway, reading the comments, several commentators expressed curiosity about how a C++0x optimized version would compare...

So, anyone here (maybe even you Herb?) feel like creating a basic C++0x optimized, or even an AMP&#039;d, PPL&#039;d or other version of the program (follow the links to find it), to raise the challenge to Go a bit further?!

I&#039;d love to here any thoughts about it even!]]></description>
