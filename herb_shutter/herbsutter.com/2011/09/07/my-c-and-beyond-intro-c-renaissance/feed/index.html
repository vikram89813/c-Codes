					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for posting this. I really enjoyed this talk and, as someone that likes programming in C++, I hope you&#039;re right.

I&#039;m not so sure that mobile represents a good long-term prospect for C++ though. Already a lot of apps are written in Java or even higher level languages like Lua or Javascript and I suspect the migration to higher level languages on mobile devices will roughly parallel that of desktop computers as the raw hardware gets faster. Particularly demanding domains like 3d games or realtime multimedia tools may always require a language like C++. But if you&#039;re just scooting widgets around like most apps then something simpler will do the job with less work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really really really^5 wish you had recorded all the talks, and made them available through purchase. They could have been enjoyed by so many people that couldn&#039;t make it or didn&#039;t get in on time.

But thanks for posting up this one.]]></description>
