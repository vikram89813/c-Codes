					<description><![CDATA[Herb,

Perhaps if the seminars were somewhere closer--Alberta is a long shot from sunny Southern California (I attended The C++ Seminar in 2002 and the location was fine, albeit somewhat cold weather).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I could be wrong, but from my perspective (we are &quot;extending&quot; our &quot;old&quot; C++ application using C#/.NET), managers believe rightly that C# is more productive than C++...

...That is, until you reach an &quot;average quality&quot; of code. The moment you want to go beyond the average, toward good, or even excellent (i.e. when performance, or perfect resource handling, etc. are important/mandatory), C#/.NET puts itself in your way, instead of helping you.

(the const keyword is sorely missing, there, and don&#039;t get me started on the Dispose pattern...)

Am I alone perceiving this (after 6+ months full of .NET coding), or is this an accurate evaluation of C#&#039;s and .NET&#039;s power scope as opposed to native C++?

If this evaluation is accurate, do our managers know about it? Or do they still remain in the dreamland of easy coding with forever junior programmers?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Question non-related directly to this post:
Are You considering rewriting &quot;Exceptional C++&quot; books , for new C++ standard?
They are something that every C++ programmer need to read (and read again, and again ...) .
It would be great ! New C++ standard will need some time for industry to catch up, and I think that publishing &quot;Exceptional C++0x&quot; can be hitting bull&#039;s eye.

Regards

					<description><![CDATA[&#062; We already know that C++ is “the” language of choice for demanding applications. Here, we’ll cover why “demanding applications” increasingly means “most applications” and will be the bread and butter of our industry for the foreseeable future. We’ll see why and where other languages are still appropriate, but why C++’s applicability and demand is now again on an upswing more so than it has been for over a decade.

From your lips to God&#039;s ear. It&#039;ll happen I&#039;m sure (I predict / predicted it too), but ugh, I&#039;m impatient.]]></description>
