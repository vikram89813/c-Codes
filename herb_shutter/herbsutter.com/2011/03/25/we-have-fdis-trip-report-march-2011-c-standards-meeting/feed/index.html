					<description><![CDATA[Thanks !
It will allow us to do a big step forward in terms of coding time and conciseness, which is always a good news.
C++ is an old language that needed and still need to catch up with productivity boost coding time features just like the way C# evolves (for having been a .NEt dev too). It is a fast languages in terms of the application speed it produces so why should it not be a fast to code language as well ? Let&#039;s beat the hell out of C# on this one too !

					<description><![CDATA[Um...  I&#039;ve just been looking in the new FDIS at the current description of how num_put is supposed to work (which is quite like the 2003 version) which it seems to me uses the word &#039;added&#039; where &#039;prepended&#039; would IMO be better on the last sentence of page 702 (2nd page of the 22.4.2.2.2 section).  (The 2003 document has the same incorrect implication.)  How can I send a comment like that to comp.std.c++ (where I assume an appropriate C++ expert might be hanging around)?

Oh, and congrats on reaching FDIS!  Can&#039;t wait for some of the some of the new stuff to become standard enough so it can be portably used!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations!!!

This is good news for those of us that have ignored the standardization process up tip now.   Stability leads to adoption and use.   Now the big question is where do vendors stand with respect to implementation?   I&#039;m especially interested in the LLVM/CLang folks myself.  

More importantly when are the books due to arrive?   Some of us still like paper you know.   Has anything been announced yet by the major writers?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I personally keep a copy of the C++ standard for use as I code.

The standard is not a good place to learn C++, and it is not the sort of thing you read cover to cover. However, it is an essential reference material. This is especially true for the standard library.

I have Jossutti&#039;s book as well; however, the standard is the best electronic reference for the standard library. Also, it spells out fine grained details that are missing from other materials.

One of C++&#039;s biggest weaknesses today is the lack of good online documentation and reference material. To get a good handle on C++ today, you need to buy yourself a pretty heavy bookshelf. I think that contributes to the problem of many programmers not having a good grasp of C++ or the standard libraries. Many programmers don&#039;t know where to get started on learning c++.

I&#039;d really like to see at least sections 17 through 27 of the standard online for free in HTML form. That way I could pass around links to functions.]]></description>
