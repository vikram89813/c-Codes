								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[6/26: Updated to add ACAT]</em></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t remember the last time I&#8217;ve gone to Europe twice in one year, but this is the year&#8230; up first are ACAT in August and CppCon in September, then a week later in early October I&#8217;ll be heading to London to give a single repeat of the three-day <em>High-Performance and Low Latency C++</em> course, in the same week that I&#8217;ll be in Europe already to give a keynote at Qt World Summit in Berlin.</p>
<h3>Aug 21-25: ACAT</h3>
<p>This year I&#8217;ll be giving a keynote at <strong><a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/567550/">ACAT</a></strong> (topic and day tbd). Unfortunately I cannot be there in person due to conflicts, but the organizers are graciously making arrangements for a remote presentation.</p>
<h3>Mon-Fri Sep 25-29*: CppCon (Seattle)</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll be giving a brand-new talk at <a href="https://cppcon.org/2017-keynote-speakers/"><strong>CppCon</strong></a>. If you haven&#8217;t <a href="https://cppcon.org/registration/">registered</a> yet for CppCon but are thinking of coming, note that the Early Bird discount ends on July 7, the end of next week.</p>
<p>* Those are the dates of the 5-day core conference, but technically the full dates are Sep 23 &#8211; Oct 1 because CppCon has grown into, somewhat incredibly, a <em>nine-day</em> event this year. How it happened: Last year, we added two days of optional pre-conference tutorials on the weekend before the conference as an experiment; those were so successful that this year there are tutorials on both weekends, before <em>and </em>after the conference, again as an experiment&#8230; but I know that at least a few of you have already signed up for all 9 days (wow).</p>
<h3>Mon-Wed Oct 9-11: High-Performance and Low-Latency C++ (London)</h3>
<p>On October 9-11, I&#8217;ll be in London giving a one-time repeat of <a href="https://www.alfasoft.com/en/events/other/683-683-high-performance-and-low-latency-c-with-herb-sutter.html"><strong>&#8220;High-Performance and Low-Latency C++&#8221; </strong>(course details page)</a>. This is the same as the public course I gave in Stockholm two months ago; because that course sold out, and I was coming to Europe again for Qt World Summit anyway, we decided to do a single repeat that same week, this time in London.</p>
<p>Notes: (1) Some of you have emailed me asking if there will be other dates/cities, and the answer is no, sorry, I do seminars very rarely and this is the last one I have time to do for the foreseeable future. So if you are interested then this is the one to attend. (2) Some of you have also emailed me to ask whether the seminar will be recorded, and the answer is again no, sorry, the organizers are not set up for that. However, you can find all of my past <em>Effective Concurrency</em> writing (on which parts of this course are based) freely available via this blog, just search for that phrase or use the category tag &#8212; there&#8217;s a book&#8217;s worth of free material written by me in individual-article form.</p>
<h3>Thu Oct 12: Qt World Summit (Berlin)</h3>
<p>The next day, I&#8217;ll be in Berlin giving one of the keynotes at <a href="https://www.qtworldsummit.com/"><strong>Qt World Summit</strong></a>. I&#8217;m not sure yet whether it&#8217;ll be the closing keynote; for more details, please check their conference schedule once it&#8217;s posted.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing many of you at these events.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t get to Europe very often apart from ISO C++ standards meetings, but this spring I&#8217;ve been able to accept invitations for two English-language European events in the last week of April. If you&#8217;re interested in attending, please check out the links, and I look forward to meeting and re-meeting many of you there.</p>
<h3>Tue-Thu Apr 25-27: High-Performance and Low-Latency C++ (Stockholm)</h3>
<p>On April 25-27, I&#8217;ll be in Stockholm (Kista) giving a three-day seminar on <strong><a href="https://www.alfasoft.com/en/events/intel/578-high-performance-and-low-latency-c-with-herb-sutter.html">&#8220;High-Performance and Low-Latency C++.&#8221;</a></strong> This contains updated and new material that reflects the latest C++ standards and compilers, with a focus to using modern C++11/14/17 effectively on modern hardware and memory architectures.</p>
<p>Note that the class size is limited to about 100, so that I&#8217;ll be able to interact with most attendees directly. Registration just opened recently and hasn&#8217;t been widely publicized yet, but today I was told that it&#8217;s already over 1/3 full. So if you or your colleagues might be interested in attending, please check out the link above; for group registrations, please contact Alfasoft directly.</p>
<p>Here is the summary, below; for a more detailed topic breakdown see the link above.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Performance and efficiency are C++’s bread and butter, and they matter more than ever on modern hardware: In processors, single-threaded performance improvements are slowing down (unless your code is parallel); in Internet of Things, we are often asked to do more work with less hardware; and in cloud computing, processor/hardware time is often the major component of cost and so making code twice as efficient often means saving close to half the processing cost. Today, getting the highest performance and the lowest latency on modern hardware often means being aware of the hardware in ways that most other programming languages can’t – from hardware caches where simply arranging our data in the right order can give 50x speedups with otherwise identical code, to hardware parallelism where using parallel algorithms turns on high-performance parallel and vector processor hardware that otherwise sits idle.</p>
<p>Additionally, low latency increasingly matters at all scales: In user interfaces, low latency means responsive apps and productive users without the dreaded “wait…” donut; in financial trading, low latency regularly saves large amounts of cash; in embedded real-time systems, low latency is crucial to meeting deadlines and can even save lives. Today, this makes concurrency more important than ever, because it delivers two things: It hides latencies we have to deal with and cannot remove, from disk I/O latency to speed-of-light network latency; and it makes our code responsive by not introducing needless latencies of our own even when we’re not hiding someone else’s latency.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>This intensive three day course will provide developers with the knowledge and skills required to write high-performance and low-latency code on today’s modern systems using modern C++11/14/17. During the training you’ll learn how to get the highest performance and the lowest latency on modern hardware in ways that are unique to C++, including how to arrange data to use hardware caches effectively, and how to use standard and your own custom-written parallel algorithms to harness high-performance parallel and vector processor hardware to compute results faster. You’ll also learn how to manage latency for responsive apps and for real-time systems, and techniques to hide the underlying latencies we have to deal with and cannot remove such as disk and network latency, and to make your own code responsive by not introducing needless latencies in your own code.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Sat Apr 29: ACCU closing keynote (Bristol)</h3>
<p>Next, I&#8217;ll be heading to Bristol to catch the end of the ACCU 2017 conference, and give the closing talk on <strong><a href="https://conference.accu.org/site/stories/2017/sessions.html#XSomethingsNewincpp">&#8220;Something(s) New in C++.&#8221;</a></strong> No, the title is not intentionally a tease; it&#8217;s just that I have several topics available, and I won&#8217;t be sure until about a month before the event which will be the best one to speak about. Here is the current abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>By the time the ACCU 2017 conference begins, C++17 is expected to be technically complete and in its final approval ballot. What comes next? Will C++ continue growing forever? Can C++ code be simplified? This is a brand-new talk of material I’ve never given before, in which I’ll present one (or more) of three proposals I’m personally working on to further improve C++ post-C++17. All follow a common theme – adding a strategic language and/or library feature to C++ that leads to significant, and sometimes dramatic, simplification of real-world C++ code. I’ll pick which one (or more) of those topics to present sometime in March.</p></blockquote>
<p>What I can say is that, whichever topic it ends up being, it&#8217;ll be something you haven&#8217;t seen before that&#8217;s forward-looking and aimed directly toward making C++ code simpler and easier&#8230; and of course without compromising C++&#8217;s model of efficient machine-near abstraction.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing many of you in Europe this spring.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of you have been asking me whether there will be some sort of <em>C++ and Beyond</em> in 2014. Also, over the past few years many of you have also asked me if there will ever be a C&amp;B outside North America. I&#8217;m pleased to report that we are doing a &#8216;European Encore&#8217; event reprising previous C&amp;B material.
</p>
<p>Today on the C&amp;B blog, Scott announced that yes, <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2014/04/07/cb-2014-september-29-october-1-in-stuttgart/">there will be a &#8220;<em>C++ and Beyond</em> Road Show&#8221; in 2014… in Germany!</a> Note that this is different from previous C&amp;B&#8217;s because the purpose is to largely repeat the C&amp;B 2013 program at an event in Europe, in order to make it accessible to people who were not able to fly to North America for previous C&amp;Bs. So think of it as a &#8220;C&amp;B Encore&#8221; or &#8220;C&amp;B Greatest Hits Roadshow Edition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>From the announcement:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can think of this event as the C&amp;B Road Show, because the organization is a little different from how we&#8217;ve done things in the past:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Most of the talks will be updated versions of the presentations we gave at C&amp;B 2013.</strong> (See the schedule <a href="http://www.qa-systems.de/akademie/einzelansicht.html?tuid=63">here</a>.) If you were unable to attend C&amp;B this past December, this is your chance to see what you missed.
</li>
<li><strong>A group dinner on the first day is included.</strong>
				</li>
<li><strong>The schedule is a bit compressed</strong>, so some aspects of previous C&amp;Bs are not present. These include group breakfasts and evening discussion sessions.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For this event, we&#8217;ve partnered with<a href="http://www.qa-systems.de/"> QA Systems</a>, the same company I&#8217;ve worked with since 1999 on technical seminars in Europe. They&#8217;ll be handling registration and all other logistical and administrative aspects of the event. Consult their <a href="http://www.qa-systems.de/akademie/einzelansicht.html?tuid=63"><strong>web page for C&amp;B 2014</strong></a> for all the details of this event.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This will be the only C&amp;B in 2014, so we hope to see you in Stuttgart at the end of September for the first-ever C&amp;B in Europe!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those of you who have attended C&amp;B before and others who&#8217;ve been asking me whether there will be a &#8220;regular&#8221; <em>C++ and Beyond</em> in North America this year with new material, the answer is not this year; we don&#8217;t do a new one every year, and we&#8217;re skipping this year. If you are looking for a C++ event in North America with new material, do check out <a href="cppcon.org">CppCon on September 7-12 in the Seattle area</a> – I am currently planning to create some new talks for CppCon, as well as to repeat some of my C&amp;B talks there. I hear tell that Scott and Andrei might be there too, as well as dozens and dozens of our closest speaker friends.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing many of you at C&amp;B Europe and CppCon this fall!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bjarne Stroustrup and I are giving back-to-back talks on Tuesday night in Chicago, while we&#8217;re both in town for the standards meeting next week. Admission is free. <a href="mailto:greg@neumarke.net?subject=Chicago%20Chapter%20ACM%20meeting%20reservation%20request">Register by email here</a> (and ignore the &#8220;it&#8217;s full / sold out&#8221; note on the page &#8212; see below.)</p>
<p>Note that my talk will be 80% new material followed by the last 5-10 min of my <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/Keynote-Herb-Sutter-One-Cpp">GoingNative 2013 keynote</a>, so even if you&#8217;ve seen that talk most of the material will be new. Here are the coordinates:</p>
<blockquote><p>A joint Chicago Chapter ACM and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-C-CPP-Users-Group">Chicago C/C++ Users Group</a> meeting</p>
<h2><a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chicagoacm.org/chicago-chapter-of-the-acm/meeting-topics/2013-09-24-onec-herb-sutter">Broad-spectrum C++/C++14 (Bjarne Stroustrup)</a></h2>

<p><strong>Tuesday, September 24, 2013</strong><br />
Doors open approximately 6:30 pm<br />
Presentations run 7:00 pm &#8211; 9:30 pm</p>
<p><strong>Renaissance Chicago Downtown Hotel</strong><br />
1 West Wacker Drive, Chicago, IL 60601<br />
Room A/B <em>[or a nearby larger room, just follow the crowd when you arrive]</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The page says the event is at capacity and the primary registration link balks, but there is space because they keep expanding the room &#8212; it has already expanded from the original 100 seats to 200 and currently 300 seats, and they&#8217;re looking into moving to a still larger room as we speak. So <a href="mailto:greg@neumarke.net?subject=Chicago%20Chapter%20ACM%20meeting%20reservation%20request">do add yourself to the waiting list via this email link as it looks likely you will still be able to get in</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/090313_1620_livestreame11.png?w=500" align="right" />Don&#8217;t forget that the year&#8217;s great C++-fest <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/Opening-Keynote-Bjarne-Stroustrup"><strong>GoingNative 2013</strong></a> starts tomorrow morning and will be <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/"><strong>livestreamed on the Channel 9 home page</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t miss the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/Opening-Keynote-Bjarne-Stroustrup">opening keynote by Bjarne Stroustrup</a> at 9:00am Seattle time on Wednesday (<a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2013&amp;month=9&amp;day=4&amp;hour=16&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=234&amp;p2=179&amp;p3=136&amp;p4=83&amp;p5=110&amp;p6=166&amp;p7=176&amp;p8=33">other time zones</a>). It will be followed by many other insightful and enlightening talks, from many of the gurus of C++. The first two days are about Standard C++ on all platforms; the third day contains a mix of portable platform topics and Microsoft-specific content that I think will be of interest to people working on other platforms too.</p>
<p>My talk is first thing Thursday, 9:00am Seattle time:</p>
<p style="margin-left:18pt;"><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/Keynote-Herb-Sutter-One-Cpp"><strong>Day 2 Keynote: One C++</strong></a><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left:18pt;">After a few minutes giving a promised update on VC++ conformance progress, I&#8217;ll switch to pure Standard C++ for the rest of the talk and focus on three topics:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:54pt;">
<li><strong>ISO C++ update:</strong> The latest news from C++14 standardization now that the CD comment ballot recently concluded.</li>
<li><strong>Portable C++ libraries update:</strong> I mentioned this at the last GoingNative, and here&#8217;s the status update people have been asking me for. This topic will get extra time for emphasis and news.</li>
<li><strong>One C++:</strong> You&#8217;ll see what I mean…</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that you&#8217;ll find it to be informative, and leave with at least one or two thoughts you weren&#8217;t expecting to hear about and maybe with a different view of C++ than you had before.</p>
<p>In addition to the livestream, the entire conference will also be available on demand. Note that sessions typically take a few days to post after they occur, so if you miss a talk on the live feed, just be patient and it will appear.</p>
<p><em>Pre-emptive FAQ:</em> Every time we do this, someone is disappointed that the livestream doesn&#8217;t work on their iPads or some other popular hardware. But it actually does work – just look for the alternative-format link if it doesn&#8217;t autodetect. You should be able to view it on any major platform.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img align="right" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/062613_1631_mybuildtal1.png?w=500" alt="" />The session schedule for this week&#8217;s //build/ conference in San Francisco has now been <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-017">posted</a>.
</p>
<p>I have a talk on Friday at noon Pacific time, titled <strong><em>&#8220;The Future of C++.&#8221;</em></strong> Note this is a Microsoft conference, so the talk is specifically about the future of the Visual C++ product, but nevertheless it&#8217;s all about Standard C++ because I&#8217;ll start with a short update on ISO goings-on and the bulk of the talk will be an update on standards conformance in Visual C++ and explaining a number of the most modern ISO C++ features.
</p>
<p>On Friday, you can watch my talk <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">live at Channel 9</a>. In the meantime, you can get the keynotes and some other major sessions at the same link all day today, tomorrow, and Friday… as I write this, a cool guy named Steve has the camera and just gave away thousands of nifty 8&#8243; tablets. I&#8217;ll be in the same place in two days to talk C++.
</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in San Francisco for //build/ and care about C++, you want to be in South Hall: Gateway Ballroom for session 2-306.
</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not at the conference but use Visual C++ as one of your C++ compilers, you&#8217;ll want to watch the talk <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">live in the webcast</a> or <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/2-306">on demand about 24-48 hours after the talk ends</a>.
</p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t use Visual C++ a lot right now, you might find some of the ISO C++ standards context and updates interesting.
</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[ETA: Updated OneDrive <a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!Aq0V7yDPsIZOgcI0y2P8R-VifbnTtw">slides link</a>]</p>
<p><img src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/021113_1851_atomicweapo1.png?w=500" alt="" align="right" />Most of the talks I gave at <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com"><em>C++ and Beyond 2012</em></a> last summer are already online at Channel 9. Here are two more.</p>
<p>This is a two-part talk that covers the C++ memory model, how locks and atomics and fences interact and map to hardware, and more. Even though we&#8217;re talking about C++, much of this is also applicable to Java and .NET which have similar memory models, but not all the features of C++ (such as relaxed atomics).</p>
<p>Note: This is about the basic structure and tools, not how to write lock-free algorithms using atomics. That next-level topic may be on deck for this year&#8217;s <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2013/02/11/cb-2013-dates-finalized-december-9-12-2013/"><em>C++ and Beyond</em> in December</a>, we&#8217;ll see…</p>
<h2>atomic&lt;&gt; Weapons: The C++ Memory Model and Modern Hardware</h2>
<ul style="margin-left:72pt;">
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Cpp-and-Beyond-2012-Herb-Sutter-atomic-Weapons-1-of-2"><span style="background-color:yellow;"><strong>Part 1:</strong></span> Optimizations, races, and the memory model; acquire and release ordering; mutexes vs. atomics vs. fences</a></li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Cpp-and-Beyond-2012-Herb-Sutter-atomic-Weapons-2-of-2"><span style="background-color:yellow;"><strong>Part 2:</strong></span> Restrictions on compilers and hardware (incl. common bugs); code generation and performance on x86/x64, IA64, POWER, ARM, and more; relaxed atomics; volatile</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This session in one word: <em><strong>Deep.</strong><br />
</em></p>
<p style="margin-left:36pt;">It&#8217;s a session that includes topics I&#8217;ve publicly said for years is Stuff You Shouldn&#8217;t Need To Know and I Just Won&#8217;t Teach, but it&#8217;s becoming achingly clear that people do need to know about it. Achingly, heartbreakingly clear, because some hardware incents you to pull out the big guns to achieve top performance, and C++ programmers just are so addicted to full performance that they&#8217;ll reach for the big red levers with the flashing warning lights. Since we can&#8217;t keep people from pulling the big red levers, we&#8217;d better document the A to Z of what the levers actually do, so that people don&#8217;t <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scram"><em>SCRAM</em></a> unless they really, really, really meant to.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p style="margin-left:36pt;"><strong>Topics Covered:</strong></p>
<ul style="margin-left:72pt;">
<li><strong>The facts: </strong>The C++11 memory model and what it requires you to do to make sure your code is correct and stays correct. We&#8217;ll include clear answers to several FAQs: &#8220;how do the compiler and hardware cooperate to remember how to respect these rules?&#8221;, &#8220;what is a race condition?&#8221;, and the ageless one-hand-clapping question &#8220;how is a race condition like a debugger?&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>The tools:</strong> The deep interrelationships and fundamental tradeoffs among mutexes, atomics, and fences/barriers. I&#8217;ll try to convince you why standalone memory barriers are bad, and why barriers should always be associated with a specific load or store.</li>
<li><strong>The unspeakables: </strong>I&#8217;ll grudgingly and reluctantly talk about the Thing I Said I&#8217;d Never Teach That Programmers Should Never Need To Now: relaxed atomics. Don&#8217;t use them! If you can avoid it. But here&#8217;s what you need to know, even though it would be nice if you didn&#8217;t need to know it.</li>
<li><strong>The rapidly-changing hardware reality: </strong>How locks and atomics map to hardware instructions on ARM and x86/x64, and throw in POWER and Itanium for good measure – and I&#8217;ll cover how and why the answers are actually different last year and this year, and how they will likely be different again a few years from now. We&#8217;ll cover how the latest CPU and GPU hardware memory models are rapidly evolving, and how this directly affects C++ programmers.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m about two weeks late posting this, but two more <em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/">C++ and Beyond 2012</a></em> videos are now available online.</p>
<p>The first is my concurrency talk:</p>
<blockquote>
<h5><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/C-and-Beyond-2012-Herb-Sutter-Concurrency-and-Parallelism"><img style="background-image:none;float:right;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border:0;" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/isocpp.org/files/img/cb12-sutter-concurrency.png" width="400" height="259" align="right" border="0" /></a><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/C-and-Beyond-2012-Herb-Sutter-Concurrency-and-Parallelism">C++ and Beyond 2012: C++ Concurrency</a> (Herb Sutter)</h5>
<p>I’ve spoken and written on these topics before. Here’s what’s different about this talk:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand new:</strong> This material goes beyond what I’ve written and taught about before in my Effective Concurrency articles and courses.</li>
<li><strong>Cutting-edge current:</strong> It covers the best-practices state of the art techniques and shipping tools, and what parts of that are standardized in C++11 already (the answer to that one may surprise you!) and what’s en route to near-term standardization and why, with coverage of the latest discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Blocking vs. non-blocking:</strong> What’s the difference between blocking and non-blocking styles, why on earth would you care, which kinds does C++11 support, and how are we looking at rounding it out in C++1y?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers all matter to you – even the ones not yet in the C++ standard – because they are real, available in shipping products, and affect how you design your software today.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second is one of the panels:</p>
<blockquote>
<h5><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/C-and-Beyond-2012-Panel-Convincing-your-Colleagues"><img style="background-image:none;float:right;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;margin:0 0 10px 10px;display:inline;padding-right:0;border:0;" title="image" alt="image" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/image1.png?w=400&#038;h=224" width="400" height="224" align="right" border="0" /></a><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/C-and-Beyond-2012-Panel-Convincing-your-Colleagues">C++ and Beyond 2012: Panel – Convincing your Colleagues</a></h5>
<p>From C++ and Beyond 2012, Andrei, Herb and Scott present Convincing Your Colleagues &#8211; an interactive panel.</p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>You can’t do a better job if you don’t change what you’re doing, but change is hard.  It’s especially hard when what needs to change is your colleagues’ approach to software development. Moving your team forward often requires persuading your peers to change their behavior, sometimes to do something they’re not doing, other times to stop doing something they’ve become accustomed to.  Whether the issue is to embrace or avoid C++ language features, to adopt new development tools or abandon old ones, to increase use of or scale back on overuse of design patterns, to adhere to coding standards, or any of the plethora of other matters that affect software creation, moving things forward typically requires getting your colleagues to buy into the change you’re proposing.  But how can you do that?</p>
<p>In this panel session, Andrei, Herb, and Scott share how they go about convincing their colleagues to change and take questions from the audience.</p></blockquote>
<p>Truth be told, the panel ranged widely and probably most of the time was on other topics!</p>
<p>I hope you find them useful.</p>

<p>This has been a phenomenal year for C++, since C++11’s publication just 12 months ago. And yesterday was a great day for C++.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had the privilege of announcing much of what Microsoft and the industry have been working on over the past year.</p>
<h2>(minor) C++ at Microsoft</h2>
<p>On September 12, we shipped VC++ 2012 with the complete C++11 standard library, and adding support for C++11 range-<em>for</em>, <em>enum class</em>, <em>override </em>and <em>final</em>. Less than two months later, yesterday we announced and shipped the November 2012 CTP, a compiler add-in to VC++ 2012 adding C++11 variadic templates, uniform initialization and <em>initializer_list</em>s, delegating constructors, function template default arguments, explicit conversion operators, and raw string literals. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2012/11/02/visual-c-c-11-and-the-future-of-c.aspx"><strong>Details here</strong></a>, and <a href="http://aka.ms/vc-ctp"><strong>download here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Note that this is just the first batch of additional C++11 features. Expect further announcements and deliveries in the first half of 2013.</p>
<h2>(major) C++ across the industry</h2>
<p>Interest and investment in C++ continues to accelerate across the software world.</p>
<ul>
<li>ISO C++ standardization is <strong><a href="http://isocpp.org/std/status">accelerating</a></strong>. Major companies are dedicating more people and resources to C++ standardization than they have in years. Over the next 24 months, we plan to ship three Technical Specifications and a new C++ International Standard.</li>
<li>C++ now has a home on the web at <a href="http://isocpp.org"><strong>isocpp.org</strong></a>. Launched yesterday, it both aggregates the best C++ content and hosts new content itself, including Bjarne Stroustrup’s new <a href="http://isocpp.org/tour">Tour of C++</a> and Scott Meyers’ new <a href="http://isocpp.org/blog/2012/11/universal-references-in-c11-scott-meyers">Universal References article</a>.</li>
<li>We now have a <a href="http://isocpp.org/about"><strong>Standard C++ Foundation</strong></a>. Announced yesterday, it is already funded by the largest companies in the industry down to startups, financial institutions to universities, book publishers to other consortia, with more members joining weekly. For the first time in C++’s history since AT&amp;T relinquished control of the language, we have an entity – a trade organization – that exists exclusively to promote Standard C++ on all compilers and platforms, and companies are funding it because the world runs on C++, and investing in Standard C++ is good business.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/11/03/our-industry-is-young-again-and-its-all-about-ui/">This is an exciting time to be part of our industry</a>, on any OS and using any language. It’s especially an exciting time to be involved with C++ on all compilers and platforms.</p>
<p>Thank you all, whatever platform and language you use, for being part of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Casablanca is a Microsoft incubation effort to support cloud-based client-server communication in native code using a modern asynchronous C++ API design. Think of it as Node.js, but using C++ – from simple services, to JSON and REST, to Azure storage and deployment, and more.</p>
<p>Casablanca gives you the power to use existing native C++ libraries and code to do awesome things on the cloud server. In this talk from TechEd Australia, <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Australia/2012/AZR331">John Azariah and Mahesh Krishnan show how it’s done</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle/">Welcome to the Jungle</a>, I predicted that “weak” hardware memory models will disappear. This is true, and it’s happening before our eyes:</p>
<ul>
<li>x86 has always been considered a “strong” hardware memory model that supports sequentially consistent atomics efficiently.</li>
<li>The other major architecture, ARM, recently announced that they are now adding strong memory ordering in ARMv8 with the new sequentially consistent <em>ldra </em>and <em>strl </em>instructions, as I predicted they would. (Actually, Hans Boehm and I influenced ARM in this direction, so it was an ever-so-slightly disingenuous prediction&#8230;)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, at least two people have been confused by what I meant by “weak” hardware memory models, so let me clarify what “weak” means – it means something different for hardware memory models and software memory models, so perhaps those aren’t the clearest terms to use.</p>
<p>By &#8220;weak <strong><em>(hardware)</em></strong> memory model&#8221; CPUs I mean specifically ones that do not natively support efficient sequentially consistent (SC) atomics, because on the <strong><em>software</em></strong> side programming languages have converged on &#8220;sequential consistency for data-race-free programs&#8221; (SC-DRF, roughly aka DRF0 or RCsc) as the default (C11, C++11) or only (Java 5+) supported software memory model for software. POWER and ARMv7 notoriously do not support SC atomics efficiently.</p>
<p>Hardware that supports only hardware memory models weaker than SC-DRF, <em>meaning that they do not support SC-DRF efficiently</em>, are permanently disadvantaged and will either become stronger or atrophy. As I mentioned specifically in the article, the two main current hardware architectures with what I called &#8220;weak&#8221; memory models were current ARM (ARMv7) and POWER:</p>
<ul>
<li>ARM recently announced ARMv8 which, as I predicted, is upgrading to SC acquire/release by adding new SC acquire/release instructions ldra and strl that are mandatory in both 32-bit and 64-bit mode. In fact, this is something of an industry first &#8212; ARMv8 is the first major CPU architecture to support SC acquire/release instructions directly like this. (Note: That’s for CPUs, but the roadmap for ARM GPUs is similar. ARM GPUs currently have a stronger memory model, namely fully SC; ARM has announced their GPU future roadmap has the GPUs fully coherent with the CPUs, and will likely add “SC load acquire” and “SC store release” to GPUs as well.)</li>
<li>It remains to be seen whether POWER will adapt similarly, or die out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that I&#8217;ve seen some people call x86 &#8220;weak&#8221;, but x86 has always been the poster child for a <strong><em>strong (hardware) </em></strong>memory model in all of our <strong><em>software</em></strong> memory model discussions for Java, C, and C++ during the 2000s. Therefore perhaps &#8220;weak&#8221; and &#8220;strong&#8221; are not useful terms if they mean different things to some people, and I&#8217;ve updated the WttJ text to make this clearer.</p>
<p>I will be discussing this in detail in my <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/06/29/cb-session-atomic-weapons-the-c11-memory-model-and-modern-hardware/">atomic&lt;&gt; Weapons</a> talk at C&amp;B next week, which I hope to make freely available online in the near future (as I do most of my talks). I’ll post a link on this blog when I can make it available online.</p>

<p>At the end of the Monday afternoon session, I will be making a special announcement related to Standard C++ on all platforms. Be there to hear the details, and to receive an extra perk that’s being reserved for <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/">C&amp;B 2012</a> attendees only.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: We sometimes record sessions and make them freely available online via Channel 9, and we intend to do that again this year for some selected sessions. <strong>However, this session is for C&amp;B attendees only and will not be recorded.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://cppandbeyond2012.eventbrite.com/">Registration is open until Wednesday</a> and the event is pretty full but a few spaces are still available. I’m looking forward to seeing many of you there for a top-notch C++ conference full of fresh new current material – I’ve seen Andrei’s and Scott’s talk slides too, and I think this C&amp;B is going to be the best one yet.</p>
<p>You’ll leave exhausted, but with a full brain and quite likely a big silly grin as you think about all the ways to use the material right away on your current project back home.</p>

We got a bigger venue this time, but as I write this the event is currently almost 75% full with five weeks to go.</p>
<p>I know, I’ve already posted <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2012/03/26/session-topic-you-dont-know-and/">three</a> <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2012/05/28/two-sessions-c-concurrency-and-parallelism-2012-state-of-the-art-and-standard/">sessions</a> and a <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2012/04/30/panel-modern-c-clean-safe-and-faster-than-ever/">panel</a>. But there’s just so much about C++11 to cover, so here’s a fourth brand-new session I’ll do at C&amp;B 2012 that goes deeper on its topic than I’ve ever been willing to go before.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2012/06/29/new-session-atomic-weapons-the-c11-memory-model-and-modern-hardware/"><font>atomic&lt;&gt; Weapons: The C++11 Memory Model and Modern Hardware</font></a></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>This session in one word: <i><strong>Deep.</strong></i> </p>
<p>It’s a session that includes topics I’ve publicly said for years is Stuff You Shouldn’t Need To Know and I Just Won’t Teach, but it’s becoming achingly clear that people do need to know about it. Achingly, heartbreakingly clear, because some hardware incents you to pull out the big guns to achieve top performance, and C++ programmers just are so addicted to full performance that they’ll reach for the big red levers with the flashing warning lights. Since we can’t keep people from pulling the big red levers, we’d better document the A to Z of what the levers actually do, so that people don’t <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scram">SCRAM</a> unless they really, really, really meant to. </p>
<p>This session covers: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The facts: </strong>The C++11 memory model and what it requires you to do to make sure your code is correct and stays correct. We’ll include clear answers to several FAQs: “how do the compiler and hardware cooperate to remember how to respect these rules?”, “what is a race condition?”, and the ageless one-hand-clapping question “how is a race condition like a debugger?” </li>
<li><strong>The tools:</strong> The deep interrelationships and fundamental tradeoffs among mutexes, atomics, and fences/barriers. I’ll try to convince you why standalone memory barriers are bad, and why barriers should always be associated with a specific load or store. </li>
<li><strong>The unspeakables: </strong>I’ll grudgingly and reluctantly talk about the Thing I Said I’d Never Teach That Programmers Should Never Need To Now: relaxed atomics. Don’t use them! If you can avoid it. But here’s what you need to know, even though it would be nice if you didn’t need to know it. </li>
<li><strong>The rapidly-changing hardware reality: </strong>How locks and atomics map to hardware instructions on ARM and x86/x64, and throw in POWER and Itanium for good measure – and I’ll cover how and why the answers are actually different last year and this year, and how they will likely be different again a few years from now. We’ll cover how the latest CPU and GPU hardware memory models are rapidly evolving, and how this directly affects C++ programmers. </li>
<li><strong>Coda: Volatile and “compiler-only” memory barriers.</strong> It’s important to understand exactly what atomic and volatile are and aren’t for. I’ll show both why they’re both utterly unrelated (they have exactly zero overlapping uses, really) and yet are fundamentally related when viewed from the perspective of talking about the memory model. Also, people keep seeing and asking about “compiler-only” memory barriers and when to use them – they do have a valid-though-rare use, but it’s not the use that most people are trying to use them for, so beware! </li>
</ul>
<p>For me, this is going to be the deepest and most fun C&amp;B yet. At previous C&amp;Bs I’ve spoken about not only code, but also meta topics like design and C++’s role in the marketplace. This time it looks like all my talks will be back to Just Code. Fun times!</p>

They made a nice recording and it’s now available online here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facebook Engineering</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151029515183109"><strong>Title: Herb Sutter: Welcome to the Jungle</strong></a></p>
<p>In the twilight of Moore&#8217;s Law, the transitions to multicore processors, GPU computing, and HaaS cloud computing are not separate trends, but aspects of a single trend—mainstream computers from desktops to &#8216;smartphones&#8217; are being permanently transformed into heterogeneous supercomputer clusters. Henceforth, a single compute-intensive application will need to harness different kinds of cores, in immense numbers, to get its job done. &#8212; The free lunch is over. Now welcome to the hardware jungle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/Welcome_to_the_Jungle_-_FB-pdf/">slides are available here</a>. (There doesn’t seem to be a link to the slides on the page itself as I write this.)</p>
<p>For those interested in a longer version, in April I gave a 105-minute + Q&amp;A version of this talk in Kansas City at Perceptive, also <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/04/23/talk-video-welcome-to-the-jungle/">available online where I posted before</a>.</p>
<h3>A word about “cluster in a box”</h3>
<p>I should have remembered that describing a PC as a “heterogeneous cluster in a box” is a big red button for people, in particular because “cluster” implies “parts can fail and program should continue.” So in the Q&amp;A, one commenter made the point that I should have mentioned reliability is an issue.</p>
<p>As I answered there, I half agree – it’s true but it’s only half the story, and it doesn’t affect the programming model (see more below). One of the slides I omitted to shorten this version of the talk highlighted that there are actually two issues when you go from “Disjoint (tightly coupled)” to “Disjoint (loosely coupled)”: <strong>reliability</strong> <em>and </em><strong>latency</strong>, and both are important. (I also mentioned this in the <a href="https://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle/">original WttJ article</a> this is based on; just search for “reliability.”)</p>
<p>Even after the talk, I still got strong resistance along the lines that, ‘no, you obviously don’t get it, latency isn’t a significant issue at all, reliability is the central issue and it kills your argument because it makes the model fundamentally different.’ Paraphrasing subsequent email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘A fundamental difference between distributed computing and single-box multiprocessing is that in the former case you don&#8217;t know whether a failure was a communication failure (i.e. the task was completed but communication failed) or a genuine failure to carry the task. (Hence all complicated two-phase commit protocols etc.) In contrast, in a single-box scenario you can know the box you&#8217;re on is working.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me respond further to this here, because clearly these guys know more about distributed systems than I do and I’m always happy to be educated, but I also think we have a disconnect on three things asserted above: It is not my understanding that reliability is more important than latency, or that apps have to distinguish comms failures from app exceptions, or that N-phase commit enters the picture.</p>
<p>First, I don’t agree with the assertion that reliability alone is what’s important, or that it’s more important than latency, for the following reason:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You can build reliable transports on top of unreliable ones.</strong> You do it through techniques like sequencing, redundancy, and retry. A classic example is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>, which delivers reliable communications over notoriously- and deliberately-unreliable IP which can drop and reorder packets as network nodes and communications paths keep madly appearing and reappearing like a herd of crazed Cheshire cats. We can and do build secure reliable global banking systems on that.</li>
<li><strong>Once you do that, you have turned a reliability issue into a performance (specifically latency) issue.</strong> Both reliability and latency are key issues when moving to loosely-coupled systems, but because you can turn the first into the second, it’s latency that is actually the more fundamental and important one – and the only one the developer needs to deal with.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to use compute clouds like Azure and AWS, you usually start with two basic pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>the queue(s), which you use to push the work items out/around and results back/around; and </li>
<li>an elastic set of compute nodes, each of which pulls work items from the queue and processes them.</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens when you encounter a reliability problem? A node can pull a work item but fail to complete it, for example if the node crashes or the system encounters a partial network outage or other communication problem.</p>
<p>Many modern systems already automatically recover and have another node re-pull the same work item to make sure each work item gets done even in the face of partial failures. From the app&#8217;s point of view, such <strong>failures just manifest as degraded performance (higher latency or time-to-solution) and therefore mainly affect the granularity of parallel work items</strong> – they have to be big enough to be worth sending elsewhere and so minimum size is directly proportional to latency so that the overheads do not dominate. They do not manifest as app-visible failures.</p>
<p>Yes, the elastic cloud implementation has to deal with things like network failures and retries. But no, this isn’t your problem; it’s not supposed to be your job to implement the elastic cloud, it’s supposed to be your job just to implement each node’s local logic and to create whatever queues you want and push your work item data into them.</p>
<p>Aside: Of course, as with any retry-based model, you have to make sure that a partly-executed work item doesn’t expose any partial side effects it shouldn’t, and normally you prevent that by doing the work in a transaction and rolling it back on failure, or in the extreme (not generally recommended but sometimes okay) resorting to compensating writes to back out partial work. </p>
<p>That covers everything except the comment about two-phase commit: Citing that struck me as odd because I haven’t heard much us of that kind of coupled approach in years. Perhaps I’m misinformed, but my impression of 2- or N-phase commit protocols was that they have some serious problems: </p>
<ul>
<li>They are inherently nonscalable. </li>
<li>They increase rather than decrease interdependencies in the system – even with heroic efforts like majority voting and such schemes that try to allow for subsets of nodes being unavailable, which always seemed fragile to me. </li>
<li>Also, I seem to remember that NPC is a blocking protocol, which if so is inherently anti-concurrency. One of the big realizations in modern mainstream concurrency in the past few years is that Blocking Is Nearly Always Evil. (I’m looking at you, <em>future.get()</em>, and this is why the committee is now considering adding the nonblocking <em>future.then()</em> as well.)</li>
</ul>
<p>So my impression is that these were primarily of historical interest – if they are still current in modern datacenters, I would appreciate learning more about it and seeing if I’m overly jaded about N-phase commit.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s time for, not one, but two brand-new, up-to-date talks on the state of the art of concurrency and parallelism in C++. I’m going to put them together <strong>especially and only for <em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/">C++ and Beyond 2012</a></em></strong>, and I’ll be giving them nowhere else this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><font size="3">C++ Concurrency – 2012 State of the Art (and Standard)</font></strong> </li>
<li><strong><font size="3">C++ Parallelism – 2012 State of the Art (and Standard)</font></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>And there’s a lot to tell. 2012 has already been a busy year for the pushing the boundaries of both “shipping-and-practical” and “proto-standard” concurrency and parallelism in C++:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In February</strong>, the <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/03/08/trip-report-february-2012-c-standards-meeting/">spring ISO C++ standards meeting</a> saw record attendance at 73 experts (normal is 50-55), and spent the full week primarily on new language and library proposals, with notable emphasis on the area of concurrency and parallelism. There was so much interest that I formed four Study Groups and appointed chairs: the largest on concurrency and parallelism (SG1, Hans Boehm), and three others on modules (SG2, Doug Gregor), filesystem (SG3, Beman Dawes), and networking (SG4, Kyle Kloepper). </li>
<li><strong>Three weeks ago</strong>, we hosted another three-day face-to-face meeting for SG1 and SG4 – and at nearly 40 people the SG1 attendance rivaled that of a normal full ISO C++ meeting, with a who’s-who of the world’s concurrency and parallelism experts in attendance and <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/04/06/we-want-await-a-c-talk-thats-applicable-to-c/">further proposal presentations</a> from companies like IBM, Intel, and Microsoft. There was so much interest that I had to form a new Study Group 5 for Transactional Memory (SG5), and appointed Michael Wong of IBM as chair. </li>
<li>Over the summer, we’ll all be working on updated proposals for the October ISO C++ meeting in Portland. </li>
</ul>
<p>Things are heating up, and we’re narrowing down which areas to focus on.</p>
<p>I’ve spoken and written on these topics before. Here’s what’s different about these talks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand new: </strong>This material goes beyond what I’ve written and taught about before in my <em>Effective Concurrency</em> articles and courses. </li>
<li><strong>Cutting-edge current:</strong> It covers the best-practices state of the art <strong>techniques</strong> and <strong>shipping tools</strong>, and what parts of that are standardized <strong>in C++11 already</strong> (the answer to that one may surprise you!) and what’s en route to <strong>near-term standardization</strong> and why, with coverage of the latest discussions. </li>
<li><strong>Mainstream hardware – many kinds of parallelism:</strong> What’s the relationship among <strong>multi-core</strong> CPUs, <strong>hardware threads</strong>, SIMD <strong>vector units</strong> (Intel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions">SSE</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">AVX</a>, ARM <a href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/neon.php">Neon</a>), and <strong>GPGPU </strong>(general-purpose computation on GPUs, which I covered at <em>C++ and Beyond 2011</em>)? Which are most interesting, what technologies are available now, and what’s being considered for near-term standardization? </li>
<li><strong>Blocking vs. non-blocking:</strong> What’s the difference between blocking and non-blocking styles, why on earth would you care, which kinds does C++11 support, and how are we looking at rounding it out in C++1<em>y</em>? </li>
<li><strong>Task and data parallelism:</strong> What’s the difference between task parallelism and data parallelism, which kind of of hardware does each allow you to exploit, and why? </li>
<li><strong>Work stealing: </strong>What’s the difference between thread pools and work stealing, what are the major flavors of work stealing, which of these (if any) does C++11 already support and is already shipping on some advanced commercial C++ compilers today (this answer will likely surprise you), and what needs to be done in the next round for a complete state-of-the-art parallelism story in C++1<em>y</em>? </li>
</ul>
<p>The answers all matter to you – even the ones not yet in the C++ standard – because they are real, available in shipping products, and affect how you design your software today.</p>
<p>This will be a broad and deep dive. At C++ and Beyond 2011, the <em>attendees</em> (audience!) included some of the world’s leading experts on parallelism and compilers. At these sessions of C&amp;B 2012, I expect anyone who wasn’t personally at the SG1 meeting this month, even world-class experts, will learn something new in these talks. I certainly did, and that’s why I’m motivated to turn the information into talks and share. This isn’t just cool stuff – it’s important and useful in production code today.</p>
<p>I hope to see many of you at C&amp;B 2012. I’m excited about these topics, and about Scott’s and Andrei’s new material – you just can’t get this stuff anywhere else.</p>
<p>Asheville is going to be blast. I can’t wait.</p>
<p>Herb</p>
<hr />
<p>P.S.: I haven’t seen this much attention and investment in C++ since last century – C++ conferences at record numbers, C++ compiler investments by the biggest companies in the industry (e.g., Clang), and much more that we’ve seen already…</p>
<p>… and a little bird tells me there’s a lot more major C++ news coming this year. Stay tuned, and fasten your seat belts. 2012 ain’t done yet, not by a long shot, and I’ll be able to say more about C++ as a whole (besides the specific topics mentioned above) for the first time at C&amp;B in August. I hope to see you there.</p>
<p>FYI, C&amp;B is already over 60% full, and early bird registration ends this Friday, June 1 – so <a href="http://cppandbeyond2012.eventbrite.com/">register today</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to know how to write cool tablet apps using Visual C++?</p>
<p>On May 18, Microsoft is hosting a <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Announcing-Building-Windows-8-Metro-Style-Apps-with-C-A-Free-Event">one-day free technical event for developers who want to write Metro apps for Windows 8 using Visual C++</a>. I’m giving the opening talk, and the rest of the day is full of useful technical information on everything from XAML and DirectX to networking and VC++ compiler flags.</p>
<p>Please note: This event is Windows-specific, and talks will use both portable ISO C++ as well as Visual C++-specific libraries and compiler extensions; for brevity these are being referred to as &quot;C++&quot; to highlight to a Microsoft-specific audience that that this day is about Visual C++, not about Visual C# or Visual Basic or JavaScript.</p>
<p>From the page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Join the Microsoft Visual C++ and Windows teams in Redmond on May 18, 2012 for a free, all-day event focused on building Windows 8 Metro style apps with C++.&#160; </p>
<p>These Windows-specific talks will use both portable ISO C++ and Visual C++-specific compiler extensions; for brevity below we&#8217;ll refer to both as &quot;C++&quot; (i.e., this day is about Visual C++, not Visual C# or JavaScript).</p>
<p>We will have pragmatic advice for every developer writing Metro style apps and games with XAML and/or DirectX and C++.</p>
<p><a href="https://win8.msregistration.com/default.aspx?ID=559a9ac4-96a6-46a1-b359-598e345d25be"><strong>Register now!</strong></a></p>
<p>Agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual C++ for Windows 8, Keynote by Herb Sutter</li>
<li>Building Windows 8 apps with XAML and C++</li>
<li>Building Windows 8 games with DirectX and C++</li>
<li>Introduction to the Windows Runtime Library&#160; (WRL)</li>
<li>Writing Connected apps: Writing networking code with C++</li>
<li>Combining XAML &amp; DirectX in a Metro style apps</li>
<li>Writing WinRT components to be consumed from any language</li>
<li>VC11 compiler flags for getting the most out of C++</li>
</ul>
<p>All sessions will be recorded and available for on demand viewing on C9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wish I’d blogged about it right away when it was announced a week or so ago, because registration filled immediately before I could blog it (I think on the first day), and then when the room was expanded it filled again right away again before I could blog about it. Then I procrastinated for a few days. You can still <a href="https://win8.msregistration.com/default.aspx?ID=559a9ac4-96a6-46a1-b359-598e345d25be">register here for the waitlist</a> to see it in person, but I have good news…</p>
<p><strong>All sessions will be broadcast livestream and then available for viewing on demand.</strong> If you’re halfway around the world, or just halfway across the country, it’s hard to fly somewhere for a one-day event anyway; thanks to livestream and on-demand, the Internet is our friend. I look forward to seeing and e-seeing many of you there.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just posted the following panel announcement to the <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com">C++ and Beyond site</a>. The three-day event (plus evening-before reception) with me, Scott Meyers, and Andrei Alexandrescu will be held on August 5-8, and <a href="http://cppandbeyond2012.eventbrite.com/">early-bird registration is open until May 31</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<hr /><a href="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/image_thumb12.png"><img title="image_thumb[1]" style="border-top:0;border-right:0;background-image:none;border-bottom:0;float:right;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;margin:10px 0 10px 10px;border-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;" border="0" alt="image_thumb[1]" align="right" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/image_thumb1_thumb.png?w=324&#038;h=184" width="324" height="184" /></a>C++11 is kind of like “C++ Dreamliner.” It’s built with world-class modern materials. It took a couple more years to finish than originally expected. But now it’s starting to roll out worldwide and flying <a href="http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/boeing-787-dreamliner-smashes-distance-and-sets-speed-records-284704">more safely and efficiently than ever</a>. (European readers may equally consider it <a href="http://www.airbus.com/aircraftfamilies/passengeraircraft/a380family/a380-800/">“C++ 380.”</a>)  </p>
<p>As I write and teach about C++11, I emphasize that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern C++ is <strong>clean, safe, and fast</strong> – modern C++ code is as readable and as type- and memory-safe as code written in any other modern language <strong>[*]</strong>, and it has always been the king of ‘fast’ and is now faster than ever with new features like move semantics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bjarne Stroustrup</strong> made me add, at the end of the “clean and safe” part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“[*] When used in a modern style.” – Bjarne Stroustrup</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bjarne and I claim this to be true. Others have disputed various parts of this statement – whether C++11 really has a usable safe subset, whether C++ is really necessarily faster than code in other languages, and other questions. What’s the truth?</p>
<p>These answers matter. Type safety and memory safety are important not only for writing reliable code that will fail or be abused less often, but also for improving developer productivity so that developers can spend less time on overhead “taxes” like checking for unsafe casts or buffer overruns. And the claim that C++ really is the king of “fast” has been consistently challenged for most of its history.</p>
<p>In this panel, Scott, Andrei, and I will weigh in with discussion – and data – on these important and current questions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month in Kansas City I gave a talk on &#8220;Welcome to the Jungle,&#8221; based on <a href="https://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle/">my recent essay of the same name</a> (sequel to &#8220;The Free Lunch Is Over&#8221;) concerning the turn to mainstream heterogeneous distributed computing and the end of Moore’s Law.</p>
<p>Perceptive Software has now made the talk available online <em>[<strong>EOA</strong>: the talk itself starts six minutes in]</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><a href="http://shadow-technologies.tv/video/179">Welcome to the Jungle</a></strong></p>
<p>In the twilight of Moore’s Law, the transitions to multicore processors, GPU computing, and HaaS cloud computing are not separate trends, but aspects of a single trend – mainstream computers from desktops to ‘smartphones’ are being permanently transformed into heterogeneous supercomputer clusters. Henceforth, a single compute-intensive application will need to harness different kinds of cores, in immense numbers, to get its job done. – The free lunch is over. Now welcome to the hardware jungle.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>Warning: It&#8217;s two hours (with Q&amp;A) because of the broad and deep material. There&#8217;s a nice pause point between major sections at the one-hour mark that makes it convenient to split it into two one-hour lunchtime brownbag viewings.</p>

Both are now online at Channel 9.</p>
<p>Here’s the 40-min C++ talk, taken from the C9 site:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>What makes ISO C++11 &quot;feel like a new language&quot;? What things that we know about past C++ do we need to unlearn? Why is C++ designed the way it is – historically, and in C++11? Finally, what is the difference between managed and native languages anyway, and when is each applicable? This talk gives an overview and motivation of modern C++ and why it&#8217;s clean, safe, and fast – as clean to code in and as type-safe as any modern language, and more than ever the king of &quot;fast.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the panel (my favorite highlight is at <strong>24:00-28:00</strong>):</p>
<blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2012/Language-Support-for-Asynchronous-Programming">nice talk by Mads Torgersen just went live on Channel 9</a> about C#’s non-blocking <em>Task&lt;T&gt;.ContinueWith()</em> library feature and <em>await</em> language feature, which are a big hit in C# (and Visual Basic) for writing highly concurrent code that looks pretty much just like sequential code. Mads is one of the designers of <em>await</em>.</p>
<p>If you’re a C++ programmer, you may be interested in this because I’ve worked to have these very features be offered as proposals for ISO C++, just with a few naming tweaks like renaming <em>Task&lt;T&gt;.ContinueWith()</em> to <em>std::future&lt;T&gt;::then()</em>. They were initially presented at the recent Kona meeting in February, and we’ll dig deeper next month at the special ISO C++ study group meeting on concurrency and parallelism.</p>
<p>Here’s the talk link and abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2012/Language-Support-for-Asynchronous-Programming">Language Support for Asynchronous Programming</a></h3>
<p><strong>Mads Torgersen</strong></p>
<p>Asynchronous programming is what the doctor usually orders for unresponsive client apps and for services with thread-scaling issues. This usually means a bleak departure from the imperative programming constructs we know and love into a spaghetti hell of callbacks and signups. C# and VB are putting an end to that, reinstating all your tried-and-true control structures on top of a future-based model of asynchrony.</p>

<p>While we were chatting after the talk, I managed to gently twist Mads’ arm and he has graciously agreed to come to the May 7-9 ISO C++ parallelism study group special meeting to present this to the committee members in detail and answer questions about <em>await</em>’s design and C# users’ experience with it in production code, which will help the committee decide whether or not this is something they want to pursue for ISO C++.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the talk. While at Lang.NEXT, I also participated in a panel and gave a C++ talk but those sessions aren’t live yet; I’ll post links once they are.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Trivia:</strong> If you noticed the Romanian accent in the first question from the audience, it’s because it came from Andrei Alexandrescu, who was sitting beside Walter Bright, both of whom were two of the other speakers at the conference. It was fun to be in a room full of language designers and implementers sharing notes about each other’s languages and experience.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/The+Knowledge+Chamber/C-A-Language-for-Modern-Times"><img style="margin:10px 0 10px 10px;display:inline;float:right;" title="image" alt="image" align="right" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/image2.png?w=360&#038;h=194" width="360" height="194" /></a>Last week I spent 30 minutes with interviewer Robert Hess to talk about the differences between managed and native languages, and why modern C++ is clean, safe, and fast – as “clean and safe” as any other modern language, and still the king of “fast.”</p>
<p>The interview just went live today on Channel 9. Here’s the blurb from the site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/The+Knowledge+Chamber/C-A-Language-for-Modern-Times"><font size="3">C++: A Language for Modern Times</font></a></strong></p>
<p>C++ has been around for what seems like forever. It might seem like it&#8217;s taken a back seat to languages that provide better application isolation and better development throughput, but in truth it remains one of the most widely used languages in the world. In order to gain some better insights on how C++ measures up in a &quot;managed&quot; world, I&#8217;ve invited Herb Sutter, Program Manager for Visual Studio, to explain how C++ has evolved and how it remains a great choice for many modern day development tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve said some of these things before, but it’s important to get the word out – modern C++11 is not your daddy’s C++, and as people return more and more to C++, we have some work still to do to help people unlearn some negative things that are no longer true (and in some cases never were true) about C++ as we know and use it today.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/image.png"><img style="margin:10px 0 10px 10px;display:inline;float:right;" title="image" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/image_thumb.png?w=360&#038;h=125" alt="image" width="360" height="125" align="right" /></a>February and March have been killer busy, so that I forgot to repeat an important announcement here: <strong><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2012/02/17/registration-for-cb-2012-is-now-open/">registration is open for C++ and Beyond 2012</a></strong>! I’m looking forward to teaching for three days again with Scott Meyers and Andrei Alexandrescu at one of the top C++ conference highlights of the year.</p>
<p>This year, C&amp;B will be held on August 5-8 in beautiful Asheville, North Carolina, USA. Registration is limited to 120 people, and now that I’m a month late in repeating this announcement I see that it’s already over 25% booked&#8230; seats are going faster than in either of the previous years, but fortunately there are still lots of spaces available as I write this.</p>
<p>This is becoming yet another big year for C++ in the industry, as C++ use and interest continues to surge and even the ISO C++ committee isn’t slowing down after delivering C++11 but is actually accelerating, ramping up work for the next round on concurrency/parallelism, networking, filesystem, and other short-term topics of interest as mentioned in my <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/03/08/trip-report-february-2012-c-standards-meeting/">trip report</a>. As usual, C++ and Beyond will feature the most important material you can use today and information about what to expect that’s coming down the pike short-term tomorrow.</p>
<p>Only two of the session descriptions have been posted so far, but they’re already deeply interesting and brand-new material never presented before – by us or by anyone, as far as I’m aware. Here they are&#8230;</p>
<h3>1. “Universal References in C++11” (brand-new talk by Scott Meyers)</h3>
<p>Scott’s first-announced talk on <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2012/03/13/session-topic-universal-references-in-c11/"><strong>“Universal References in C++11”</strong></a> targets a key underpinning of two C++11 marquee features – move semantics and perfect forwarding. I’ve seen drafts of the material, and this is going to be a deeply illuminating talk that covers not only the “what” and “how” of thinking about and effectively using <em>T&amp;&amp;</em> declarations in C++, but also the “why” – the thinking behind the language rules that helps us to understand the reasons why this important C++11 feature was designed the way it is, and what other topics and techniques it affects.</p>
<h3>2. “You Don’t Know [keyword] and [keyword]” (brand-new talk by Herb Sutter)</h3>
<p>Yes, the title really is <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2012/03/26/session-topic-you-dont-know-and/"><strong>“You Don’t Know [keyword] and [keyword],”</strong></a> at least for now. Here’s the description I just posted:</p>
<blockquote><p>I plan to give a brand-new talk for the first time at C&amp;B, but I&#8217;m conflicted regarding what to say about it here because it&#8217;s recently been a bit of a startling realization to me about C++11, and I think it may be a bit startling for others too. I don&#8217;t want to be a tease, but I also want to save it as a surprise for C&amp;B itself.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here’s a teaser&#8230;</p>
<p>In addition to the many new C++11 features that everyone’s listing, it has dawned on me over the winter that there’s actually another major change that isn’t being talked about anywhere, or even being listed as a change in C++11 at all as far as I know, because I and other key experts and committee members I’ve asked didn’t fully realize that we altered the basic meaning of not one but two fundamental keywords in C++. It’s a change that has profound consequences, that rewrites and/or invalidates several pieces of pre-C++11 design guidance, and that’s directly related to writing solid code in a concurrent and parallel world. This isn&#8217;t just an academic change, either – everyone is going to have to learn and apply the new C++11 guidance that we&#8217;ll cover in this session.</p>
<p>I plan to talk about it first at C&amp;B, in a session tentatively titled as above – I’ll fill in the keywords later. You may already guess a few keyword candidates based on the description above, and here’s a final hint: You’ll hardly find two C++ keywords that are older, or whose meanings are more changed from C++98 to C++11. (No, they aren&#8217;t <em>auto</em> and <em>register</em>.)</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope you can come, and I’m looking forward to seeing many of you in Asheville this summer.</p>

<p>The talk will be based on <a href="https://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle/">my recent essay of the same name</a> (sequel to ”The Free Lunch Is Over”) concerning the turn to mainstream heterogeneous distributed computing and the end of Moore’s Law, with ample time for Q&amp;A and discussion.</p>
<p>Here are the coordinates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.perceptivesoftware.com/discover/herbsutter/">Computing Trends with Herb Sutter: Welcome to the Jungle</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, March 20 at 1:00 – 3:00 P.M.</p>
<p><strong>Where: </strong><a href="http://binged.it/wYRLlS">Boulevard Brewery</a>, 2501 Southwest Blvd, Kansas City, MO, USA 64108</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the twilight of Moore’s Law, the transitions to multicore processors, GPU computing, and HaaS cloud computing are not separate trends, but aspects of a single trend – mainstream computers from desktops to ‘smartphones’ are being permanently transformed into heterogeneous supercomputer clusters. Henceforth, a single compute-intensive application will need to harness different kinds of cores, in immense numbers, to get its job done. – The free lunch is over. Now welcome to the hardware jungle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a free lecture; all are invited, but you should register to make sure you’ll have a seat. Note that this talk is live only and is not being recorded or webcast.</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting many of you there in person.</p>

<p>My two talks from last week&#8217;s <a href="http://buildwindows.com">//build/</a> conference are online.</p>
<p>My personal favorite is <strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/TOOL-835T">Writing Modern C++ Code: How C++ Has Evolved Over the Years</a></strong>. The thesis is simple: Modern ISO Standard C++ code is clean, safe, and fast. C++ has got a bad rap over the years, partly earned, but that&#8217;s history. This talk is a &#8220;welcome to modern C++&#8221; for programmers who may never have seen C++ before, or are familiar only with older and more difficult C++.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re already a modern C++ developer you may be thinking, &#8220;but I do most of those things already, why is there a whole talk on this at a Microsoft conference?&#8221; Because as interest and use of Standard C++ is heating up again, it&#8217;s important to ensure that people have a good experience as they return to C++, or turn to it for the first time. Thus we sometimes have called this the &#8220;happy path&#8221; talk &#8212; designed to show the simple happy path through modern C++ that avoids needless pitfalls.</p>
<p>My other talk was <strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/TOOL-532T">Using the Windows Runtime From C++</a></strong>. This is Windows 8-specific and talks about the &#8220;foreign object model&#8221; language extensions used by Visual C++ 11 to talk to the new native ABI-safe WinRT types. These extensions should be used sparingly, only on the thin module boundaries around otherwise nice and portable Standard C++ code, and it was necessary to add them only because Standard C++ types aren&#8217;t ABI-safe and accessible safely from other languages. (If ISO C++ were to get a module system at some point that includes being able to talk about ABI-safe types on module boundaries, that would be happiness indeed!) There is also a template library called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh309536%28VS.85%29.aspx">Windows Runtime C++ Template Library (WRL)</a> that is another way to access basically the same functionality using template syntax; pick whichever you like best.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who attended!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just posted two more sessions I&#8217;ll be giving next month at <em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com">C++ and Beyond</a></em>. (Aside: If you&#8217;re interested in coming, <a href="http://cppandbeyond2011.eventbrite.com/">register</a> soon; there are now only 11 seats left.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/07/08/session-announcement-c-renaissance/">&#8220;C++ Renaissance.&#8221;</a></em></strong> I’ve been asked to give the opening “Welcome, Everyone!” keynote talk at C&amp;B 2011, and it’s time to cover an increasingly open secret: After a decade-long affair with managed languages where it became unfashionable to be interested in C++, C++’s power and efficiency are now getting very fashionable again. At the same time, C++ has been getting easier to use; key productivity features from the C++0x standard (aka C++11), like auto and lambdas, are increasingly widely available in commercial compilers and making using C++ easier than ever before without sacrificing its cornerstone — efficiency.This opening 40-minute talk covers the reasons why C++ is now enjoying a major <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=C%2B%2B+renaissance">renaissance</a>, and why that will continue to grow over the next few years because of industry trends from processor design to mobile computing to cloud and datacenter environments.We already know that C++ is “the” language of choice for demanding applications. Here, we’ll cover why “demanding applications” increasingly means “most applications” and will be the bread and butter of our industry for the foreseeable future. We’ll see why and where other languages are still appropriate, but why C++’s applicability and demand is now again on an upswing more so than it has been for over a decade.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/07/08/session-announcement-how-to-teach-todays-c/">&#8220;How to Teach Today&#8217;s C++.&#8221;</a></em></strong>  With the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=C%2B%2B+renaissance">C++ Renaissance</a> gathering steam, I’ve personally noticed a growing need to train developers who are now turning or returning to C++. These developers don’t need to be taught how to program, but they aren’t familiar with how clean it is to write code using today’s C++. The key is: What is the best and clearest way to teach the essentials of today’s C++ — both what to teach, and what not to teach?This session shows that it is possible to show a very clean path through today’s C++ that is available to production developers right now, including use of key C++0x features already supported in many compilers, that shows how clean C++ code can be and how it compares favorably to code written in managed languages while still retaining its longstanding efficiency advantage.Many attendees coming to <em>C++ and Beyond</em> are experienced developers, often in senior or leadership positions. Your company may look to you to define or personally provide training in the best development techniques, whether through team brownbags or formal training sessions. As developers continue to come back to C++, you will find yourself increasingly called upon to help them quickly learn what “modern C++” really means today, and how clear and compelling it can be. This “train the trainers” session is intended to provide the foundation for that training, and give you the tools you need to train others, as we welcome them (and welcome them back) to our good friend C++.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve already posted these other sessions, which round out my solo talk slots (not counting panels where Scott and Andrei and I will also all participate):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/02/session-announcement-c-and-the-gpu-and-beyond/">“C++ and the GPU… and Beyond.”</a></em></strong> I’ll cover the state of the art for using C++ (not just C) for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPGPU">general-purpose computation on graphics processing units (GPGPU)</a>. The first half of the talk discusses the most important issues and techniques to consider when using GPUs for high-performance computation, especially where we have to change our traditional advice for doing the same computation on the CPU. The second half focuses on upcoming C++ language and library extensions that bring key abstractions for GPGPU — and in time considerably more — directly into C++.</li>
<li> <em><strong><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/12/session-announcement-exceptional-c0x-aka-c11/">“Exceptional C++0x (aka C++11)”</a></strong></em> that shows how the new features in C++0x change the way we solve problems, our C++ coding style, and even the way we think about our code. I’ll demonstrate that with code that works today on existing compilers, using selected familiar examples from my <em>Exceptional C++ </em>books. This is not rehashed material, as I’ll assume you’re already familiar with the pre-C++0x solutions (I’ll provide links to read as refreshers before the course), and then we’ll analyze and solve them entirely the 21st-century C++ way and see why C++0x feels like a whole new fresh language that leads to different approaches, new and changed guidelines, and even better solutions. As Bjarne <a href="http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/C++0xFAQ.html">put it</a>: “Surprisingly, C++0x feels like a new language: The pieces just fit together better than they used to and I find a higher-level style of programming more natural than before and as efficient as ever.” This talk will show why — deeply, madly, and truly.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I had the privilege of talking about some of the work we&#8217;ve been doing to support massive parallelism on GPUs in the next version of Visual C++. The video of my talk announcing C++ AMP <strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/AFDS-Keynote-Herb-Sutter-Heterogeneous-Computing-and-C-AMP">is now available on Channel 9</a></strong>. (Update: Here&#8217;s an <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/AMD-Fusion-Developer-Summit/AMD-Fusion-Developer-Summit-11/KEYNOTE">alternate link</a>; it seems to be posted twice.)</p>
<p>The first 20 minutes has nothing to do with C++ in particular or any platform in particular, but tries to make the case that the right way to view the &#8220;trends&#8221; of multicore computing, GPU computing, and cloud computing (HaaS) is that they are not three trends at all, but merely facets of the same single trend &#8212; heterogeneous parallel computing.</p>
<p>If they are, then one programming model should be able to address them all. We think we&#8217;ve found one.</p>
<p>The main reasons we decided to build a new model is that we believe there needs to be a single model that has all of the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>C++, not C:</strong> It should leverage C++&#8217;s power for strong abstraction without sacrificing performance, not just be a dialect of C.</li>
<li><strong>Mainstream:</strong> It should be programmable by millions of developers, not just by a priesthood. Litmus test: Is the Hello World parallel GPU program a page and half, or a couple of lines?</li>
<li><strong>Minimal:</strong> It adds just one general-purpose language extension that addresses not only the immediate problem (dealing with cores that can&#8217;t support full C++) but many others. With the right general-purpose extension, the rest can be done as just a library.</li>
<li><strong>Portable:</strong> It allows shipping a single EXE that can use any combination of GPU vendors&#8217; hardware. The initial implementation uses DirectCompute and supports all devices that are DX11 capable; DirectCompute is just an implementation detail of the first release, and the model can (and I expect will) be implemented to directly talk to any interesting hardware.</li>
<li><strong>General and future-proof:</strong> The initial release will focus on GPU computing, but it&#8217;s intended to enable people to write code for the GPU in a way that in the future we can recompile with few or no changes to spread across any and all accessible compute cores, including ones in the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Open:</strong> I mentioned that Microsoft intends to make the C++ AMP specification open, and encourages its implementation on other C++ compilers for any hardware or OS target. AMD announced that they will implement C++ AMP in their FSA reference compiler. NVidia also announced support.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;re really excited about this, and I hope you find the information in the talk to be useful. A prerelease implementation in Visual C++ that runs on Windows will be available later this year. More to come&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2011/05/04/interview-on-channel-9-2/">last Channel 9 video interview</a> seems to have been well-received, and some people suggested Charles should have asked about additional topics.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s my idea: Let&#8217;s do another C9 interview, this time with your questions &#8212; hard or soft, big or small, just not too bizarre or personal please. :)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how I&#8217;ll try to take them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post your question(s) below as a reply to this post. Post as many questions as you like, but please make each one a separate reply for better clarity.</li>
<li>Return often to vote your and others&#8217; questions up or down. That way I know what&#8217;s of interest to lots of people, rather than spending 10% of the interview answering something of interest to only one person.</li>
<li>Charles will pepper me with the top-rated questions and we&#8217;ll get through as many as we can in some reasonable time (30 minutes? though once we get going we tend to be hard to stop). We&#8217;ll try to do it somewhere with a whiteboard as I expect that&#8217;ll be handy.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, now it&#8217;s all yours&#8230; reply below as often as you like, and vote the questions up/down early and often.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update, June 7: </em></strong><em>The followup interview <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Herb-Sutter-C-Questions-and-Answers">is now live</a>. Thanks for all your questions, and we took as many of the most popular ones as we could!</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Channel 9 just posted a new <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Conversation-with-Herb-Sutter-Perspectives-on-Modern-C0x11">interview with me</a> about ISO C++0x, C++&#8217;s place in the modern world, and all things C++. The topics we talked about ranged pretty widely, as you can see from the questions below.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the blurb as posted on Channel 9 with links to specific questions in the interview. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Herb</p>
<blockquote><p>I was lucky enough to catch up with <a href="https://herbsutter.com/" target="_blank">Herb Sutter</a> not too long after the <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2011/03/25/we-have-fdis-trip-report-march-2011-c-standards-meeting/" target="_blank">FDIS announcement</a> (Final Draft International Standard is complete).</p>
<p>As usual when talking to Herb, the conversation is all about C++ (well, we <em>do</em> talk about C# for a little while, but in the context of C++. Why? Tune in&#8230;).</p>
<p>See below for the specific questions that were asked. You can simply click on a link to move directly to that point in the conversation. I do, however, strongly recommend that <em>you watch the entire thing</em>. I also recommend that you don&#8217;t get used to this level of categorization in my videos (it takes a fair amount of time to do this sort of thing, so enjoy the times when I actually do this, but don&#8217;t expect me to do this all of the time).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always great to talk to Herb and get a glimpse of what goes on in the C++ Standards Committee (which Herb chairs). In this specific conversation, it&#8217;s uplifting to see how excited Herb is for the future of one of the world&#8217;s most capable and widely used general purpose programming languages. C++ is a modern programming language for power and performance, but it&#8217;s also a highly abstracted general purpose language for building user mode applications, mobile apps, etc. The amazing part is how C++ can provide rich general programming abstractions and also ensure that your code can run at machine speeds. We talk about this, of course.</p>
<p>Tune in. Learn. Go native!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scott Meyers, Andrei Alexandrescu and I are continuing to craft and announce the technical program for <strong><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/">C++ and Beyond (C&amp;B) 2011</a></strong>, and two more sessions are now posted. All talks are brand-new material created specifically for C&amp;B 2011. Here are short blurbs; follow the links for longer descriptions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scott will give a great new talk on <em><strong><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/11/session-announcement-the-c0x-memory-model-and-why-you-care/">&#8220;The C++0x Memory Model and Why You Care&#8221;</a></strong></em> that will cover topics of interest to anybody who cares about concurrency and parallel programming under C++0x: everything from compiler optimizations and memory access reorderings, to “sequenced before” and “happens before” relations, to atomic types and memory consistency models, and how they all relate to both correctness and performance. This is stuff that in a perfect world nobody should ever have to know, but in our actual world every modern C++ developer who cares about correct high-performance code has to understand it thoroughly.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll be giving a brand-new talk  <em><strong><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/12/session-announcement-exceptional-c0x-aka-c11/">&#8220;Exceptional C++0x (aka C++11)&#8221;</a></strong></em> that shows how the new features in C++0x change the way we solve problems, our C++ coding style, and even the way we think about our code. I&#8217;ll demonstrate that with code that works today on existing compilers, using selected familiar examples from my <em>Exceptional C++</em> books. This is not rehashed material, as I&#8217;ll assume you&#8217;re already familiar with the pre-C++0x solutions (I&#8217;ll provide links to read as refreshers before the course), and then we&#8217;ll analyze and solve them entirely the 21st-century C++ way and see why C++0x feels like a whole new fresh language that leads to different approaches, new and changed guidelines, and even better solutions. As Bjarne <a href="http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/C++0xFAQ.html">put it</a>: &#8220;Surprisingly, C++0x feels like a new language: The pieces just fit together better than they used to and I find a higher-level style of programming more natural than before and as efficient as ever.&#8221; This talk will show why &#8212; deeply, madly, and truly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other two talks already announced are the following, which I <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2011/04/05/c-and-beyond-2011/">previously reported last week</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrei will be giving an in-depth talk on <strong><em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/03/31/session-announcement-big/">“BIG: C++ Strategies, Data Structures, and Algorithms Aimed at Scalability.”</a></em></strong> Briefly, it’s about writing high-performance C++ code for  highly distributed architectures, focusing on translating C++’s strong modeling capabilities directly to great scaling and/or great savings, and finding the right but non-intuitive C++ techniques and data structures to get there.</li>
<li>I’ll be giving a brand-new talk on <strong><em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/02/session-announcement-c-and-the-gpu-and-beyond/">“C++ and the GPU… and Beyond.”</a></em></strong> I’ll cover the state of the art for using C++ (not just C) for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPGPU">general-purpose computation on graphics processing units (GPGPU)</a>. The first half of the talk discusses the most important issues and techniques to consider when using GPUs for high-performance computation, especially where we have to change our traditional advice for doing the same computation on the CPU. The second half focuses on upcoming C++ language and library extensions that bring key abstractions for GPGPU — and in time considerably more — directly into C++.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope to see many of you there this August. Last year&#8217;s event sold out during the early-bird period, and although we&#8217;ve increased the attendance cap this year to make room for more, if you&#8217;re interested in coming you may want to <a href="http://cppandbeyond2011.eventbrite.com/">register</a> soon to reserve a place.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a couple of months, I&#8217;ll be giving a keynote at the <a href="http://developer.amd.com/afds/">AMD Fusion Developer&#8217;s Summit</a>, which will be held on June 13-16, 2011, in Bellevue, WA, USA.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my talk&#8217;s description as it <a href="http://developer.amd.com/afds/pages/keynote.aspx">appears</a> on the conference website:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><a href="http://developer.amd.com/afds/pages/keynote.aspx">AFDS Keynote: “Heterogeneous Parallelism at Microsoft”</a></strong><br />
<em>Herb Sutter, Microsoft Principal Architect, Native Languages</em></p>
<p>Parallelism is not just in full bloom, but increasingly in full variety. We know that getting full computational performance out of most machines—nearly all desktops and laptops, most game consoles, and the newest smartphones—already means harnessing local parallel hardware, mainly in the form of multicore CPU processing. This is the commoditization of the supercomputer.</p>
<p>More and more, however, getting that full performance can also mean using gradually ever-more-heterogeneous processing, from local GPGPU and Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) flavors to “often-on” remote parallel computing power in the form of elastic compute clouds. This is the generalization of the heterogeneous cluster in all its NUMA glory, and it’s appearing at all scales from on-die to on-machine to on-cloud.</p>
<p>In this talk, Microsoft’s chief native languages architect shares a vision of what this will mean for native software on Microsoft platforms from servers to devices, and showcases upcoming innovations that bring access to increasingly heterogeneous compute resources — from vector units and multicore, to GPGPU and APU, to elastic cloud — directly into the world’s most popular native languages.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in high performance code for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPGPU">GPUs</a>, <a href="http://sites.amd.com/us/fusion/apu/Pages/fusion.aspx">APUs</a>, and other high-performance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym">TLAs</a>, I hope to see you there.</p>
<p>Note: This talk is related to, but different from, the <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/02/session-announcement-c-and-the-gpu-and-beyond/">GPU talk I&#8217;ll be presenting</a> in August at <em><a href="https://herbsutter.com/2011/04/05/c-and-beyond-2011/">C++ and Beyond 2011</a></em> (aka C&amp;B). You can expect the above keynote to be, well, keynote-y&#8230; oriented toward software product features and of course AMD&#8217;s hardware, with plenty of forward-looking industry vision style material. My <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/02/session-announcement-c-and-the-gpu-and-beyond/">August C&amp;B technical talk</a> will be just that, an in-depth performance-oriented and sometimes-gritty technical session that will also mention product-related and hardware-specific stuff but is primarily about heterogeneous hardware, with a more pragmatically focused forward-looking eye.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Beautiful Banff" src="https://cppandbeyond.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/banffsprings.jpg?w=240&#038;h=165" alt="" width="240" height="165" />I&#8217;m very much looking forward to <strong><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com">C++ and Beyond 2011</a></strong> this August, again with Scott Meyers and Andrei Alexandrescu. All of my own talks will be brand-new material never given publicly before.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s program will be heavily oriented toward performance (first) and C++0x (second). There are two talks announced so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrei will be giving an in-depth talk on <strong><em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/03/31/session-announcement-big/">&#8220;BIG: C++ Strategies, Data Structures, and Algorithms Aimed at Scalability.&#8221;</a></em></strong> Briefly, it&#8217;s about writing high-performance C++ code for  highly distributed architectures, focusing on translating C++&#8217;s strong modeling capabilities directly to great scaling and/or great savings, and finding the right but non-intuitive C++ techniques and data structures to get there.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll be giving a brand-new talk on <strong><em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/02/session-announcement-c-and-the-gpu-and-beyond/">&#8220;C++ and the GPU&#8230; and Beyond.&#8221;</a></em></strong> I&#8217;ll cover the state of the art for using C++ (not just C) for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPGPU">general-purpose computation on graphics processing units (GPGPU)</a>. The first half of the talk discusses the most important issues and techniques to consider when using GPUs for high-performance computation, especially where we have to change our traditional advice for doing the same computation on the CPU. The second half focuses on upcoming C++ language and library extensions that bring key abstractions for GPGPU — and in time considerably more — directly into C++.</li>
</ul>
<p>An announcement for a third (also performance-focused) talk should be posted within the week, with more to come as we continue to announce the talk schedule as it firms up.</p>
<p><a href="http://cppandbeyond2011.eventbrite.com/">Registration is now open.</a> I hope many of you will be able to make it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At PDC 2010 this week, I participated in a panel and gave one talk. Both are now online for live on-demand viewing.</p>
<p><strong>Note: The talks should work on any browser.</strong> They <span style="text-decoration:underline;">do not</span> require Silverlight. If you get a message that Silverlight is needed, it just made a mistake in auto-detecting your browser (I&#8217;m told this happens with Firefox sometimes), so just click on one of the alternate formats and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob's_your_uncle">Bob&#8217;s your uncle</a>.</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/bU23S2">1. Languages Panel</a> (update: <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/PDC/PDC10/FT11">new link</a>)</strong></p>
<p>I got to participate again this year on a fun panel on programming languages and software development, together with fellow panelists <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/techfellow/hejlsberg/default.mspx">Anders Hejlsberg</a> (creator of Turbo Pascal, Delphi, and C#), <a href="http://bracha.org/Site/Home.html">Gilad Bracha</a> (of Java and Newspeak fame), and <a href="http://www.caplet.com/">Mark S. Miller</a> (of Ecmascript and E and general security fame). Our esteemed moderator, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/emeijer/">Erik Meijer</a>, is one of the original designers of LINQ in C# and has contributed heavily to many other languages.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/dcJcXN">2. Lambdas, Lambdas Everywhere</a> (update: <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/PDC/PDC10/FT13">new link</a>)</strong></p>
<p>This is a shortened version of the full lambdas talk I gave at C&amp;B on Wednesday, and will be giving again at <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/">C++ and Beyond Encore</a> this December. To get the full talk, come to C&amp;B Encore&#8230; but to get a good chunk of it, check out this version online.</p>
<p>Note: Just before the talk, I went around the room to chat with individual attendees, and discovered that a lot of the audience members were C# programmers who didn&#8217;t realize this was a C++ talk. Just before we went live, I spoke up to the room and alerted everywhere about that, and nearly everyone stayed anyway, which was nice. But if you wonder why I mentioned C# lambdas a number of times to this audience, that&#8217;s why.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll be posting abstracts (summaries) of the <em>C++ and Beyond 2010</em> sessions over the coming days over at the C&amp;B <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com">site</a>. Below is the first, for my talk on <strong><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2010/10/07/session-details-lambdas-lambdas-everywhere/">&#8220;Lambdas, Lambdas Everywhere.&#8221;</a></strong></p>
<p>This is a brand new talk. I delivered a &#8216;sneak peek&#8217; preview of a subset of this material in conjunction with the ISO C++ standards meeting in Switzerland two months ago, but the full talk will be given publicly for the first time at <em>C++ and Beyond</em>.</p>
<p>Historical trivia: This talk exists because Bjarne Stroustrup asked for it. Bjarne knew that I felt lambda functions were a game-changing feature that would have a pervasive impact on C++ coding style across many domains, and he asked me to write up the examples demonstrating why. This talk is the result.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why care about C++0x lambda functions? Syntactically, they are nothing but sugar for function objects. However, they are an essential and enabling sugar that will change the way we will write C++ code more often than most people realize.</p>
<p>This talk will cover what lambda functions are and how to use them effectively, including how lambdas touch many wide-ranging kinds of code — from their convenience when writing concurrent and scalably parallel code, to how they stand to revolutionize STL usability and programming, to how they enable such small conveniences as local functions and local variable initialization.</p>
<p>Note that lambda functions, although futuristic, are not a far-future feature. They are available today in several shipping C++ compilers, including Intel C++ 11, Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, and gcc 4.5. The future is now. Come find out how this powerful feature affects you and your code.</p>
<p><em>About the speaker:</em> Herb Sutter is an architect on the Windows C++ team at Microsoft and the chair of the ISO C++ standards committee. He is the main designer of lambda functions in Visual C++ 2010 and their integration with the VC++ Parallel Patterns Library, and is partly responsible for the design of lambda functions in the C++0x standard, notably their final syntax.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://cppandbeyondencore.eventbrite.com/">Public registration is now open</a></strong> for the overflow “Encore” showing of <em>C++ and Beyond. </em>The deadline for early-bird discount registration is November 14, but if you want to make sure you get a place it would probably be good to register sooner (the first showing sold out during the early-bird period).</p>
<p>If you weren’t able to get into the first one before it sold out, here is <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2010/09/22/encore-cb-to-repeat-december-13-16/">a second chance to attend the same event</a> with the same speakers; the <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2010-10/hotel/">same location</a>; and the <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2010-10/schedule/">same solid technical program</a> on C++ and directly related technologies, including many new and up-to-the-minute-current talks that have never before been presented publicly anywhere else. The only thing that’s different is the date: <em>C++ and Beyond Encore</em> runs from December 13 (evening) through 16, 2010.</p>
<h3>Technical Program</h3>
<p>The talk schedule with titles and speakers is available at the <strong><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2010-10/schedule/">Location and Schedule</a> </strong>page. The topics are designed to provide a balance of useful and pragmatic material, ranging from broadly applicable design techniques to hard-core deep dives on specific important language features. The program includes substantial coverage of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>C++0x features and impact:</strong> In-depth discussion of move semantics (Scott) and lambdas (me) take up most of  day 1.</li>
<li><strong>High performance:</strong> Hardware performance issues and techniques in Scott’s “CPU Caches” talk on day 2, and then a double-barreled hit on day 3 with Andrei’s “CAS” talk on high performance concurrency and his “Super Size Me” talk on scalability-focused issues.</li>
<li><strong>Effective design:</strong> On day 2 Andrei has lots to say revisiting “Containers and Iterators,”  and I’ll be launching day 3 with “Elements of Design” focused on design lessons learned in many domains but all useful today in your production C++ code.</li>
<li><strong>Three panels:</strong> The first and last are dedicated to answer your questions, submitted in advance and live at the event. The second promises to be an interesting and informative “cage match” where each of the speakers will choose two or three issues that they feel strongly about, but that are potentially controversial and bound to lead to lots of instructive discussion and debate about ideal designs and pragmatic tradeoffs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We look forward to seeing many of you in the beautiful Pacific Northwest later this year!</p>
<p>Watch the <em>C++ and Beyond</em> <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com">site</a> and <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/feed/">RSS feed</a> for further announcements, including detailed talk abstracts to be posted soon.</p>
<p><em>Updated 10/22 to remove the deferred GotW-0x talk.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I forgot to blog about this until now because of focusing on the Effective Concurrency course in Stockholm a few weeks ago, but to answer those who wonder if I’ll be giving it again in North America too: Yes, I’m also giving the public <a href="http://www.construx.com/Page.aspx?nid=17&amp;id=108"><strong>Effective Concurrency course</strong></a> again at the end of this month at the Construx facility in Bellevue, WA, USA. This will be the full four-day version of the course. Spaces are still available.</p>
<p>I’ll cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fundamentals: </strong>Define basic concurrency goals and requirements • Understand applications’ scalability needs • Key concurrency patterns</li>
<li><strong>Isolation — Keep work separate: </strong>Running tasks in isolation and communicate via async messages • Integrating multiple messaging systems, including GUIs and sockets • Building responsive applications using background workers • Threads vs. thread pools</li>
<li><strong>Scalability — Re-enable the Free Lunch:</strong> When and how to use more cores • Exploiting parallelism in algorithms • Exploiting parallelism in data structures • Breaking the scalability barrier</li>
<li><strong>Consistency — Don’t Corrupt Shared State:</strong> The many pitfalls of locks–deadlock, convoys, etc. • Locking best practices • Reducing the need for locking shared data • Safe lock-free coding patterns • Avoiding the pitfalls of general lock-free coding • Races and race-related effects</li>
<li><strong>High Performance Concurrency:</strong> Machine architecture and concurrency • Costs of fundamental operations, including locks, context switches, and system calls • Memory and cache effects • Data structures that support and undermine concurrency • Enabling linear and superlinear scaling</li>
<li><strong>Migrating Existing Code Bases to Use Concurrency </strong></li>
<li><strong>Near-Future Tools and Features </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope to see some of you there!</p>
<p><strong>Update 8/19:</strong> I had planned to do the EC course again in October (hence the post title) but that now has to be deferred to sometime in the new year. Sorry for any inconvenience to those of you who had already registered, or were planning to. I&#8217;ll blog about it here when it&#8217;s rescheduled.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2010/05/06/may-12-webinar-on-multicore-parallelism/">webinar</a> I did with James Reinders three weeks ago is now online for on-demand viewing. The link is the same as before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://event.on24.com/event/36/88/3/rt/1/index.html?&amp;eventid=36883&amp;sessionid=1&amp;key=D76A2FD29D7444AEC06765011A2D4953&amp;tab=1&amp;sourcepage=register">Five Years Since Free Lunches: Making Use of Multicore Parallelism</a></strong></p>
<p>Reflecting on the five years since &quot;The Free Lunch is Over&quot; article and the arrival of multicore processors, Sutter and Reinders will talk about the keys to making effective use of multicore parallelism. Programmers are in the midst of an evolution that takes time, and we are still in the early days. Sutter and Reinders share expert advice on how to view this transition, and the keys to getting it right—including a three-pillar model for concurrency, the need to maximize the number of tasks expressed in a program, and how abstractions encourage &quot;many task&quot; programming, while allowing overheads to be driven down under-the-covers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intel wants you to register (which is free), then you can watch the video and listen to the live (and sometimes quite lively) Q&amp;A we held at the end. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
<p>Note: When we did it live, the audio was missing for part of the presentation. I’m told the glitch has been fixed, and the complete video, soundtrack and all, is available in the on-demand version.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/">C++ and Beyond 2010</a></strong> (October 24-27) is filling up quickly. As of this writing, nearly 40 of the 60 places have been taken since registration opened last month.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking of registering, it would probably be good to do it soon. 60 attendees is a hard limit; as I’ve written <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2010/01/11/c-and-beyond-summer-2010-vote-the-date/">before</a>, we want to have lots of face time with individual attendees. So once we hit 60, registration will close, although we’ll probably set up a waiting list for those of you that don’t quite make it into the first 60 so that you’ll get dibs if there are any cancellations.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to seeing many of you in beautiful Snoqualmie, WA, USA this fall.</p>
