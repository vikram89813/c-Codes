								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Atwood’s post two days ago inspired me to write this down. Thanks, Jeff.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“I can&#8217;t even remember the last time I was this excited about a computer.”</em></p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/11/do-you-wanna-touch.html">Jeff Atwood, November 1, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Our industry is young again, full of the bliss and sense of wonder and promise of adventure that comes with youth.</p>
<p><strong>Computing feels young and fresh</strong> in a way that it hasn’t felt for years, and that has only happened to this degree at two other times in its history. Many old-timers, including myself, have said “this feels like 1980 again.”</p>
<p>It does indeed. And the reason why is all about user interfaces (UI).</p>
<h2>Wave 1: Late 1950s through 60s</h2>
<p>First, computing felt young in the late 1950s through the 60s because it <em>was</em> young, and made computers personally available to a select few people. Having computers at all was new, and the ability to make a machine <em>do </em>things opened up a whole new world for a band of pioneers like Dijkstra and Hoare, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!"><strong>Russell (Spacewar!)</strong></a> and <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2009/01/08/answer-to-16-technologies-engelbart-and-the-mother-of-all-demos/"><strong>Engelbart (Mother of All Demos)</strong></a> who made these computers personal for at least a few people.</p>
<p>The machines were useful. But the excitement came from <em>personally interacting</em> with the machine.</p>
<h2>Wave 2: Late 1970s through 80s</h2>
<p>Second, computing felt young again in the late 1970s and 80s. Then, truly personal single-user computers were new. They opened up to a far wider audience the sense of wonder that came with having a computer of our very own, and often even with a colorful graphical interface to draw us into its new worlds. I’ll include <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure">Woods and Crowther (ADVENT)</a></strong> as an example, because they used a PDP as a personal computer (smile) and their game and many more like it took off on the earliest true PCs – Exidy Sorcerers and TRS-80s, Ataris and Apples. This was the second and much bigger wave of delivering computers we could personally interact with.</p>
<p>The machines were somewhat useful; people kept trying to justify paying $1,000 for one “to organize recipes.” (Really.) But the real reason people wanted them was that they were more intimate – the excitement once again came from <em>personally interacting </em>with the machine.</p>
<h2>Non-wave: 1990s through mid-2000s</h2>
<p>Although WIMP interfaces proliferated in the 1990s and did deliver benefits and usability, they were never as exciting to the degree computers were in the 80s. Why not? Because they weren’t nearly as transformative in making computers more <em>personal</em>, more fun. And then, to add insult to injury, once we shipped WIMPiness throughout the industry, we called it good for a decade and innovation in user interfaces stagnated.</p>
<p>I heard many people wonder whether computing was done, whether this was all there would be. Thanks, Apple, for once again taking the lead in proving them wrong.</p>
<h2>Wave 3: Late 2000s through the 10s</h2>
<p>Now, starting in the late 2000s and through the 10s, modern mobile computers are new and more personal than ever, and they’re just getting started. But what makes them so much more personal? There are three components of the new age of computing, and they’re all about UI (user interfaces)… count ’em:</p>
<ol>
<li>Touch.</li>
<li>Speech.</li>
<li>Gestures.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now don’t get me wrong, these are in addition to keyboards and accurate pointing (mice, trackpads) and writing (pens), not instead of them. I don’t believe for a minute that keyboards and mice and pens are going away, because they’re incredibly useful – I agree with <a href="http://joey.hess.usesthis.com/">Joey Hess</a> (HT to @codinghorror):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“If it doesn’t have a keyboard, I feel that my thoughts are being forced out through a straw.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, touch, speech, and gestures are clearly important. Why? Because <strong>interacting with touch and speech and gestures is how we’re made, and that’s what lets these interactions power a new wave of making computers more personal.</strong> All three are coming to the mainstream in about that order…</p>
<h2>Four predictions</h2>
<p>… and all three aren’t done, they’re just getting started, and we can now see that <strong>at least the first two are inevitable</strong>. Consider:</p>
<p>Touchable screens on smartphones and tablets is just the beginning. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/11/do-you-wanna-touch.html">Once we taste the ability to touch any screen, we immediately want and expect all screens to respond to touch.</a> One year from now, when more people have had a taste of it, no one will question whether notebooks and monitors should respond to touch – though maybe a few will still question touch televisions. Two years from now, <strong>we’ll just assume that every screen should be touchable</strong>, and soon we’ll forget it was ever any other way. Anyone set on building non-touch mainstream screens of any size is on the wrong side of history.</p>
<p>Speech recognition on phones and in the living room is just the beginning. This week I recorded a podcast with <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a> which will air in another week or two, when Scott shared something he observed firsthand in his son: Once a child experiences saying “Xbox Pause,” he will <strong>expect all entertainment devices to respond to speech commands</strong>, and if they don’t they’re “broken.” Two years from now, speech will probably be the norm as one way to deliver primary commands. (Insert <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hShY6xZWVGE">Scotty joke</a> here.)</p>
<p>Likewise, gestures to control entertainment and games in the living room is just the beginning. Over the past year or two, when giving talks I’ve sometimes enjoyed messing with audiences by “changing” a PowerPoint slide by gesturing in the air in front of the screen while really changing the slide with the remote in my pocket. I immediately share the joke, of course, and we all have a laugh together, but the <strong>audience members more and more often just think it’s a new product and expect it to work</strong>. Gestures aren’t just for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)">John Anderton</a> any more.</p>
<p>Bringing touch and speech and gestures to all devices is a thrilling experience. They are just the beginning of the new wave that’s still growing. And this is the most personal wave so far.</p>
<p>This is an exciting and wonderful time to be part of our industry.</p>
<p>Computing is being reborn, again; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv6dMFF_yts">we are young</a> again.</p>

Here’s one about us: The difference between the best worker on computer hardware and the average may be 2 to 1, if you&#8217;re lucky. With automobiles, maybe 2 to 1. But in software, it&#8217;s at least 25 to 1. [&#8230;]]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, Brent Schlender published <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/165/steve-jobs-highlights">selected Steve Jobs quote highlights</a> from his interview tape archives.</p>
<p>Here’s one about us:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>The difference between the best worker on computer hardware and the average may be 2 to 1, if you&#8217;re lucky. With automobiles, maybe 2 to 1. But in software, it&#8217;s at least 25 to 1. The difference between the average programmer and a great one is at least that.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>This illustrates that there’s always lots of headroom to keep growing as a developer. We should always keep learning, and strive to become ever stronger at our craft.</p>
<p>You might also enjoy the history and observant commentary in Schlender’s other new article <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/165/steve-jobs-legacy-tapes">The Lost Steve Jobs Tapes</a>, which focuses on “the wilderness years.”</p>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></p>
<p>What is built becomes our future<br />
Hand-constructed, stone by stone<br />
Quarried by our elders&#8217; labors<br />
Fashioned with their strength and bone<br />
Dare to dream, and dare to conquer<br />
Fears by building castles grand<br />
But ne&#8217;er forget, and e&#8217;er remember<br />
To take a new step we must stand<br />
On the shoulders of our giants<br />
Who, seeing off into the morrow,<br />
Made the dreams of past turn truth &#8212;<br />
How their passing is our sorrow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking as a neutral observer with exactly zero opinion on any political question, and not even a cyberpunk reader given that I&#8217;ve read about two such novels in my life: Is it just me, or do the last few months&#8217; global news headlines read like they were ghostwritten by <a href="http://www.nealstephenson.com/">Neal Stephenson</a>?</p>
<p>I wonder if we may look back on 2010 as the year it became widely understood that we now live in a cyberpunk world. Many of 2010&#8217;s top stories read like sci-fi:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stuxnet:</strong> Sovereign nations (apparently) carry out <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/11/stuxnet-sabotage-centrifuges/">successful attacks</a> on each other with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">surgically crafted malware</a> &#8212; viruses and worms that target specific nuclear facilities, possibly causing more damage and delay to their targets&#8217; weapons programs than might have been achieved with a conventional military strike.</li>
<li><strong>Wikileaks:</strong> <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2010/12/half-formed-thought-on-wikileaks-global-action/">Stateless &#8216;Net organizations</a> operating outside national laws fight information battles with major governments, up to and including the strongest industrial and military superpowers. The governments react by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/dec/01/wikileaks-website-cables-servers-amazon">applying political pressure to powerful multinational corporations</a> to try to force the stateless organizations off the &#8216;Net and cut off their support and funding, but these efforts succeed only temporarily as the target keeps moving and reappearing.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymous:</strong> Small vigilante groups of private cybergunners retaliate by (or just latch onto a handy excuse to go) carrying out global attacks on the websites of multinational corporations, inflicting enough damage on <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/12/08/news/companies/mastercard_wiki/index.htm">Visa and Mastercard</a> to temporarily take them off the &#8216;Net, while being <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/12/09/technology/amazon_wikileaks_attack/index.htm">repelled by cyberfortresses like Amazon</a> and Paypal that have stronger digital defenses. But before we get too confident about Amazon&#8217;s strength, remember that this definitely ain&#8217;t the biggest attack they&#8217;ll ever see, just a 21st-century-cyberwar <em>hors d&#8217;oeuvre: </em>Who were these global attackers? About 100 people, many of them teenagers.</li>
<li><strong>Assange:</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange">Charismatic cyberpersonalities</a> operating principally on the &#8216;Net live as permanent residents of no nation, and roam the world (until arrested) wherever they can jack in, amid <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=assassinate+assange">calls for their arrest and/or assassination</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Kinect:</strong> Your benevolent (you hope) living room game console <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvvQJxgykcU">can see you</a>. Insert obligatory <em>Minority Report UIs no longer sci-fi</em> line here, with optional reference to <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a></em>.</li>
<li><strong>Other:</strong> Never mind that organized crime has for years now been well-known to be behind much of the phishing, spam, <a href="http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/articles.php?art_id=3199">card skimming</a>, and other electronic and &#8216;Net crimes. Not new to 2010, but seeing a significant uptick in the continued transition from boutique crime to serious organization and <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2009/april/spearphishing_040109">spear-phishing</a> targeting specific high-profile organizations <a href="http://www.securitynewsdaily.com/phishing-scam-targets-us-military-0252/">including the U.S. military</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the coming months and years, it will be interesting to see how multinational corporations and sovereign governments react to what some of them no doubt view as a new stateless &#8212; transnational? extranational? supernational? &#8212; and therefore global threat to their normal way of doing business.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These are the two best links I’ve read in the wake of the Flash and HTML5 brouhaha(s). They discuss other informative points too, but their biggest value lies in discussing three things, to which I’ll offer the answers that make the most sense to me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the web, really?</strong> “The web” is the <em>cross-linked content</em>, regardless of what in-browser/PC-based/phone-based generator/viewer/app is used to produce it and/or consume it. </li>
<li><strong>Does web == in-browser?</strong> No. Native apps can be web apps just as much so as in-browser ones, and increasingly many native apps are web apps. Conversely, not everything that runs in a browser is part of the web, even though most of them are for the obvious historical reasons.</li>
<li><strong>Is it necessary/desirable/possible to make in-browser apps be like native apps?</strong> No, maybe, and maybe. The jury is still out, but at the moment developers are still trying while some pundits keep decrying.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the two articles.</p>
<h3><a href="http://benward.me/blog/understand-the-web"><strong>Understand the Web</strong></a><strong> (Ben Ward)</strong></h3>
<p>This rambly piece needs serious editing, but is nevertheless very informative. Much of the debate about Flash and/or HTML5 conflates two things: the web, and application development platforms. They aren’t the same thing, and in fact are mostly orthogonal. From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think about that word; ‘web’. Think about why it was so named. It’s nothing to do with rich applications. Everything about web architecture; HTTP, HTML, CSS, is designed to serve and render content, but <em>most importantly</em> the web is formed where all of that content is linked together. That is what makes it amazing, and that is what defines it.</p>
<p><em>… [in the confused Flash and HTML5 debates] </em>We’re talking about two very different things: The web of information and content, and a desire for a free, cross-platform Cocoa or .NET quality application framework that runs in the browsers people already use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a different note, speaking of the desire for super-rich in-browser apps, he adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally, aside from all of this almost ideological disagreement over what the web is for, and what you can reasonably expect it to be good at, I honestly think that ‘Desktop-class Web Applications’ are a fools folly. Java, Flash, AIR and QT demonstrate right now that cross-platform applications are <em>always</em> inferior to the functionality and operation of the native framework on a host platform. Steve Jobs is right in his comments that third-party frameworks are an obstacle to native functionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/05/05/HTML5-and-the-Web"><strong>HTML5 and the Web</strong></a><strong> (Tim Bray)</strong></h3>
<p>Again, what “the web” is – and it has nothing specifically to do with HTML. From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Web is a tripod, depending critically on three architectural principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pieces of the Web, which we call Resources, are identified by short strings of characters called “URIs”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work is accomplished by exchanging messages, which comprise metadata and representations of Resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The representations are expressed in a number of well-defined data formats; you can count on the message data to tell you which one is in use. It is essential that some of the representation formats be capable of containing URIs. The “Web” in WWW is that composed by the universe of Resources linked by the URIs in their representations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all. You notice that there’s nothing there that depends crucially on any flavor of HTML. Speaking only for myself, an increasingly large proportion of my Web experience arrives in the form of feed entries and Twitter posts; not HTML at all, but 100% part of the Web.</p>
<p><strong>On Flash</strong> · This may be a side-trip, but anyhow: I entirely loathe Flash but by any definition it’s part of the Web. It works just fine as a resource representation and it can contain URI hyperlinks.</p>
<p>… <strong>Native Applications</strong> · A large proportion of the native applications on iPhone, and on Android, and on Windows, and on Mac, and on Linux, are Web applications. They depend in a fundamental way on being able to recognize and make intelligent use of hyperlinks and traverse the great big wonderful Web.</p>
<p>… So whatever you may think of native applications, please don’t try to pretend that they are (or are not) necessarily good citizens of the Web. Being native (or not) has nothing to do with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good stuff.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Appetizers: Three cool links</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Essays-Computer-Scientist-ebook/dp/B003DKG5H6"><em>The Design of Design</em> by Fred Brooks</a> (Amazon)<br />
</strong>Yes, a new book by <em>the</em> Fred Brooks. Started reading it in Stanza on my iPhone today…</p>
<p><a href="http://aturingmachine.com/"><strong>A Turing Machine</strong></a><strong> (aturingmachine.com)<br />
</strong>I’m in love. This is my favorite computer ever. I <em>so</em> want one.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/Articles/2010/04/01/The-Evolution-of-Visual-C-in-Visual-Studio-2010.aspx">The Evolution of Visual C++ in Visual Studio 2010</a> (VS Magazine)<br />
</strong>A summary of what’s new in VC++ 2010, from the C++0x language and library features, to concurrency runtime and libraries, to faster and more accurate Intellisense (running the EDG engine), and more. All I can say is that VS 2010 is available imminently…</p>
<h3>Entree: My favorite link this week</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/mobility/222700087">What the iPad Really Is</a> (Michael Swaine, Dr. Dobb’s)<br />
</strong>Swaine gets it. The iPad is a “read-mostly” and “anywhere” device.</p>
<p>That’s why Steve Jobs is correct that this segment between notebooks and phones exists, and that serving that segment expands the market rather than competing directly with either neighboring segment. The tablet, spelled with “i” or otherwise, mostly doesn’t compete with desktops and notebooks (except for users who only do read-mostly stuff) or smartphones (except for users who need a bigger screen); it complements both. I’ve been using Windows convertible tablets off and on for years for this part of my computing life.</p>
<p>For my tablet needs, the iPad as launched had only two disappointments. The killer piece of missing software was a OneNote equivalent, and the killer piece of missing hardware was a stylus – really, because I want to finally have a real paper-notebook replacement. My convertible tablet/notebook has these covered, but maybe if a dedicated tablet can match this part too it can take over the “tablet segment” for me and I can go back to a notebook that’s a dedicated notebook. We’ll see.</p>
<p>Incidentally, now with Netflix (if it’s not a 4/1 joke) and Hulu and Flickr and ABC joining the burgeoning flood, it looks more and more like <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/04/netflix-hulu-cbs-abc-ted-flickr-more-readying-for-ipad.ars">“iPad, iPad everywhere”</a>…</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This morning my colleague Rob Hanz wrote an interesting email that went viral in my corner of Microsoft. He graciously allowed me to share it with you here. I hope you enjoy it too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Blink and subconscious messaging       <br /></strong><em>Robert Hanz</em></p>
<p>I was reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(book)">Blink</a> last night, and one of the things it mentioned is how subconscious signals can significantly impact conscious activity. For instance, one experiment took jumbled, semi-random words and had the subjects arrange them into sentences. After they finished these, they would need to go down to the hall and speak to a person at an office to sign out of the test.</p>
<p>But the test wasn’t the actual sentences – mixed in with the words to form sentences were one of two sets of words. One set had a lot of words regarding patience and cooperation, while the other had words regarding belligerence and impatience. The test was to see the behavior of the student when the person they needed to talk to was engaged in a conversation and was unable to help them.</p>
<p>The group that had the belligerent words waited, on average, about 5 minutes before interrupting the conversation. The group with the patient wordset waited indefinitely. The test was designed to end after I believe 10 minutes of waiting – not a single “patient” subject ever interrupted the conversation.</p>
<p>Reading this, one of the things that came to mind was some of the different messaging used by waterfall projects vs. agile projects, and how often we hear them.</p>
<p>Waterfall:     <br />“Bug” (used for just about anything that needs to be done by a developer)      <br />“Priority one”      <br />“Due by”      <br />“Stabilization”      <br />(this in addition to the frequently long list of “bugs” that confronts developers every day)</p>
<p>Agile:     <br />“User story”      <br />“Customer value”      <br />“Velocity”      <br />(in addition, the list of work to be done is usually scoped to be possible within a single week)</p>
<p>When I thought about the differences in words, I was really struck by how different the messaging was. In the waterfall case, the message was overwhelmingly negative – it focused on failures, urgency, and almost a sense of distrust. It seemed that the language seemed to be geared around ways that individuals messed up, and how everything is an emergency that must be dealt with immediately. And, if you think about it, in a waterfall culture there is typically no frequent reward or messaging of success – the best you can typically hope for (for much of the cycle) is to avoid failure. And the idea that you’re actually producing value is very much removed from the language.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the agile language itself focuses on results, not failures. Stories are typically “done” or “not done,” and while bugs are certainly tracked, at a high level that’s usually just a statement that the story is “not done.” Combine this with sprint reviews (where the team shows what they’ve accomplished), and the overall message becomes very much focused on the successes of the team, rather than the failures. Progress is measured by value added, not by failures avoided. Even something as low-level as TDD consistently gives its practitioners a frequent message of success with the “green bar.”</p>
<p>While I certainly believe that agile development has many advantages in terms of reducing iteration time and tightening feedback loops, among other things, is it possible that something as simple as the shift in language is also a significant part of the effectiveness? That by priming individuals with messages of success and value, rather than messages of failure, that morale and productivity can be boosted?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This afternoon I was just finishing up my next Effective Concurrency article (it’ll be up in a few days), when some spam email arrived. Just as my fingers’ auto-delete macro was about to fire, I noticed something odd about the name of the attachment and did a double-take:</p>
<p><a href="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/image.png"><img title="image" style="border-right:0;border-top:0;display:inline;border-left:0;border-bottom:0;" height="178" alt="image" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/image_thumb.png?w=405&#038;h=178" width="405" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>Cool! There must be some kind of new truth-in-advertising laws for spammers.</p>
<p>Yes, I know that as programmers we could argue about naming all day long. We could point out that maybe “virusLoader.gif” or “exploit_exploit_muhaha.gif” would be a little better, and argue about the relative merits of camel case and underscores. But there’s no need; I think “runnable.gif” is short, clear, and definitely good enough. (Evidently someone else thought so too, and just shipped it.)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seen at a gas station:</p>
<p><a href="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/img-0220.jpg"><img title="IMG_0220" style="display:inline;border-width:0;" height="480" alt="IMG_0220" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/img-0220-thumb.jpg?w=360&#038;h=480" width="360" border="0" /></a> </p>
</p>
</p>
<p>You know your UI has usability issues when people tape multiple signs on your gas pump to help people get through the intricate and error-prone process of purchasing fuel.</p>
<p>Why does the upper note exist? The trouble is that there’s a Debit button but not a Credit button, and so since Credit is the default, users need to remember to override the default before swiping the card. People will sometimes naturally forget the special step because there was originally no reminder that this needed to be done, and because most other pumps don’t work that way. One solution would be to print the information prominently near the card reader, thus standardizing the note and making it more visible. A better and simpler solution would be to do what most pumps do: Avoid the opportunity for forgetting to specify the right thing by having both buttons, Debit and Credit, and simply prompting the user to press one or the other after they swipe their card.</p>
<p>But the trouble behind the lower note is even more blatant and, frankly, inexcusable: Is there any good reason not to conditionally print “ENTER PIN” or “ENTER ZIP,” instead of just always printing “ENTER DATA” which is not only unclear but also one of the classic geeky words to avoid in a consumer-oriented UI?</p>
<p>Then again, I’m amazed that in this day and age I still see output like “1 item(s) purchased.” Apparently it’s still more important to write the programmer-friendly <em>printf( “%d item(s)”, count )</em> than the user-friendly <em>printf( “%d item%s”, count, (count==1 ? “” : “s”) )</em>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just saw a CNN headline that read: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/business/2009/02/04/chang.china.living.cheap.cnn">“Young workers scrimp to live on $15/wk.”</a> Before reading further, what do you think: Is that stunning and shocking? Or shockingly typical?</p>
<p>The story turned out to be a piece about white-collar workers in China trying to live frugally, spending only 100 Yuan on travel and food during the workweek to conserve funds. Of course, the workers’ actual total expenses and income are higher, because that $15/week figure doesn’t include weekend expenses and other major costs like rent. Even so, the story is considered newsworthy here, and is probably a shock to a number of readers in the western world.</p>
<p>But the headline wouldn’t surprise readers who are familiar with the approximate distribution of income/GDP/wealth in the world.</p>
<p>To illustrate, here are two personal data points from 2006, when my wife and I traveled to Kenya and Zambia to visit friends:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Income:</strong> In <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/country/ke-kenya/eco-economy">Kenya</a>, we were told that being a staff worker at a safari lodge is considered a good job. What does it pay? About $2 per day, for long hours and six-day weeks. This isn’t unusual; in about 30 countries, including Kenya, more than half of the population <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_pop_und_2_a_day-economy-population-under-2-day">earns under $2 per day</a>. <strong>An estimated two billion people – 30% of the world’s population – live on an income of less than $3 per day.</strong> And $3 per day is about what the attention-grabbing CNN headline implies, though the actual story behind that headline is much less bad.</li>
<li><strong>Cost of living:</strong> But what happens when we consider, not just dollar-for-dollar comparisons, but purchasing power? Isn’t it less expensive to live in less-developed countries? Yes, it usually is, especially for shelter and services – there’s been some talk lately on the U.S. news about retiring in Mexico as a way for older people to save money in this economy – but the difference for the same quality goods is often less than one might think. In Lusaka, the capital of <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/country/za-zambia/eco-economy">Zambia</a>, we found there were only three grocery stores [*] having similar goods to what we would expect to find in a U.S.-style Safeway, although of course the Zambian stores were much smaller than U.S. stores (more the size of a medium Trader Joe’s) and offered far less selection diversity (something like a factor of 20 fewer varieties or brands). When we visited one of the stores, I picked up a few Western-style items, totaled the price and converted to U.S. dollars in my head, and found that those <strong>comparable products in Lusaka cost nearly the same as we would have paid for the same items in Seattle</strong>. Our local friend replied: “Right, nobody who lives here would ever think of buying a can of soda pop.” Certainly not when a can of <a href="http://www.pepsi.com/">Coke</a> costs a day’s wage for many people, and doesn’t confer any significant nutritional benefit. </li>
</ul>
<p>The gulf between the western- and world-median standards of living is, simply put, vast – and growing. The standard of living that’s normal for most of the planet’s population is well nigh unimaginable to many of us in the western world, and even for those of us who’ve been there, it’s one thing to see it and quite another to really understand what such a life would be like. I don’t claim to.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>[*] They might well be the only such stores in the country, not just the capital.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[6/25: Added YouTube availability and notes.]</em></p>
<p>A few weeks ago, the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">BBC</a> was in town to tape a special interview/documentary on Bill Gates. As part of the footage they got, there&#8217;s a Bill-in-a-technical-review-meeting shot that includes yours truly at a whiteboard presenting an overview-plus-drilldown on <a href="https://herbsutter.wordpress.com/2008/03/29/trip-report-februarymarch-2008-iso-c-standards-meeting/">C++0x lambda functions</a>. It was a good review; Bill&#8217;s a sharp guy with a broad and deep background and incisive questions.</p>
<p><a href="http://open2.net/money/trailers_summer_08_1.html">Here&#8217;s the trailer</a> and <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=2gOrWBPt1bA&amp;feature=related">the program</a> [YouTube]. Some bits of our VC++ team review start around 4:30 of part one and 8:05 of part two, with a few other shots later on. If you watch really closely, you can see a brief flash of a guy in a blue shirt at a whiteboard with code on it in HerbWhiteboardScrawl Sans 60pt, and then Bill gesturing and making comments about simulating lambdas using macros instead of baking them into the language, and variable capture consequences.</p>
<p>The BBC documentary <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7461783.stm">&#8220;How a Geek Changed the World&#8221;</a> first aired today in the UK on BBC2; I&#8217;m guessing it will repeat. I don&#8217;t know when it will air in the U.S, but as of this writing it&#8217;s <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=2gOrWBPt1bA&amp;feature=related">on YouTube</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I had a nice lesson in transaction codes. I did a happy little online transaction, and then the confirmation screen came up with what at first glance looked like an error. It startled me, until I read more closely:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="ofAltBackgroundColorD9 ofAlt0Border">Thank you. Your transaction has been placed and received by SuperMondoCorp.</span></p>
<p>Transaction Confirmation Number: <strong>ER6661234567</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Yikes!&#8221; thought I to myself, thought I. Then, &#8220;oh, the bolded confirmation number just starts with <strong>ER</strong> which only looks like <strong>ERR</strong>.&#8221; (And yes, the rest of the number did start with 666. I only altered the other numbers.)</p>
<p>I realize you can&#8217;t anticipate everything, but it is a reminder about usability. If the thing you draw the customer&#8217;s eye to on a confirmation screen can start with what looks like a negative confirmation, it&#8217;s not the greatest thing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I knew <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor">Hanlon&#8217;s Razor</a>: &quot;<em>Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.&quot; </em>And the variants attributed to Heinlein, described on the same page as adding &quot;<i>&#8230; but don&#8217;t rule out malice.&quot;</i> or &quot;<i>&#8230; but keep your eyes open.&quot;</i> </p>
<p>But I only just now came across Grey&#8217;s Law, which follows the flavor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_Three_Laws">Clarke&#8217;s Third Law</a>: &quot;<em>Any sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice.&quot;</em> </p>
<p>One example that irritates me too is <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001011.html">focus-stealing popups</a>. Grr, no, I didn&#8217;t mean that enter key to select &quot;Reboot&quot;, I was just finishing a paragraph or writing a space. Please, Mr. Callous Software Developer, just leave me alone! I don&#8217;t care how important you think your application is &#8212; it&#8217;s never important enough to pop up on top without warning. <strong>No.</strong> Bad developer. Down. I said <strong>down.</strong> Stay. </p>
<p>As a counterexample, I really like how Windows handles the &quot;are you sure you want to run this application?&quot; dialog. Not only does it not steal focus&#8230; even better, <strong>it ignores the first mouse click when it gets focus.</strong> That&#8217;s right, if the window is visible but not active, and you click on the &quot;Run&quot; button, <strong>it doesn&#8217;t also push Run</strong> &#8212; it merely makes the window active. Then if you hit Run again, it runs. Yes! Good developer! </p>
<p>To paraphrase Hill Street Blues: Let&#8217;s be thoughtful out there.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When someone I&#8217;ve just met asks me what I do for a living and I say I work in software, I sometimes hear wistful responses like, &quot;Oh, that&#8217;s cool and it must be a lot of fun. All I do is&#8230;&quot; followed by carpentry, plumbing, teaching, farming, or another occupation or trade. </p>
<p>To me, that&#8217;s backwards: Any of those things is at least as important, and at least as worthy of respect and appreciation, as what we technologists do. I usually respond by saying so, and adding: &quot;When the power goes out, I&#8217;m pretty much useless; worse still, everything I&#8217;ve ever made stops working. What <em>you</em> make still keeps working when the power is out.&quot; </p>
<p>I can make a pretty good argument that the non-technology skills are more valuable/applicable, but the more important thing is that all skills are deserving of respect and appreciation. Technology has done wonders, and it&#8217;s super fun to be involved in that and to have our advances and skills recognized; after all, software has helped build the tools we use to make other real things, including cars and buildings and spacecraft. But it&#8217;s unfortunate when sometimes people who focus too heavily on the so-called &quot;higher technology&quot; skills forget, or devalue, the people and skills that built their house, their couch, and their car. Nearly everyone has skills and personal value worth appreciating. </p>
<p><u><font color="#669966"><a href="http://www.ratzenberger.com/about/index.html">John Ratzenberger</a></font></u> makes a similar point: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The manual arts have always taken precedence over the fine arts. I realized that there is no exception to that rule. You can&#8217;t name a fine art that isn&#8217;t dependent on a manual art. Someone&#8217;s got to build a guitar before Bruce Springsteen can go to work. Someone had to build a ceiling before Michelangelo could go to work.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We live in a richly technologically enabled society, which we can and should enjoy. But when a natural disaster (or just a programming glitch) strikes, and we&#8217;re suddenly without power and Nothing Works Any More, we realize how fragile our comfort infrastructure can be. </p>
<p>A couple of months ago here in the northwest United States and western Canada, we had a windstorm that left 1.5 million people without power. Our house was dark and cold for just three nights; many of our friends were out for a week. It can be startling to find oneself unable to talk to anyone without physically going to them: Our cell phones didn&#8217;t work at our house, because many cell towers had no power. Many people were chagrined to discover that their landline telephones didn&#8217;t work either, because even though the phone lines were fine, the telephone (or base station for a cordless phone) that most people attach requires separate power. Skype wasn&#8217;t an option, needless to say, even while the laptop batteries held out. Thus cut off, we were reduced to walking, or driving where trees didn&#8217;t block the roads and if you could find a gas station whose pump was working (those pumps usually need electricity too). </p>
<p>Interestingly, the home phone would have been fine had we been using a retro 1950&#8217;s-era handset. We&#8217;ve now purchased one to keep around the house for next time. Sometimes simpler is better, even if you can&#8217;t see the caller ID. </p>
<p>After the storm, who was it who restored our comfort infrastructure, removed fallen trees, and repaired broken houses and fences? Primarily, it wasn&#8217;t us technology nerds &#8212; it was the electricians, the carpenters and the plumbers. How we do appreciate them! Fortunately, those people in return also appreciate the software, smartphones, PDAs, and other wonders that our industry produces that help them in their own work and leisure, which makes us feel good about being able to contribute something useful back, and so we all get to live in a mutual admiration society. </p>
<p>Thanks for the thought, John. Oh, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083399/">Cheers!</a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/stevewozniak.html">wonderful interview</a> with <a href="http://www.woz.org/">The Other Steve (Wozniak)</a> on the start of Apple. It&#8217;s part of a new book called <em><a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/">Founders At Work</a></em>, full of similar interviews with all sorts of well-known founders of companies/products from Adobe and Lotus to TiVo and Ruby on Rails. (I don&#8217;t have any commercial interest in the book; I just heard about it via the blogosphere.) </p>
<p>Fair warning: It&#8217;s a long interview. But it&#8217;s fascinating. Here&#8217;s a small excerpt that resonates strongly with me in our highly complexified world of deeply layered and arbitrarily composed software, where programmers are all too often insulated from knowing the true cost of something as simple as a library call: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Livingston:</b> What is the key to excellence for an engineer?  </p>
<p><b>Wozniak:</b> You have to be very diligent. You have to check every little detail. You have to be so careful that you haven&#8217;t left something out. You have to think harder and deeper than you normally would. It&#8217;s hard with today&#8217;s large, huge programs.  </p>
<p>I was partly hardware and partly software, but, I&#8217;ll tell you, I wrote an awful lot of software by hand (I still have the copies that are handwritten) and all of that went into the Apple II. Every byte that went into the Apple II, it had so many different mathematical routines, graphics routines, computer languages, emulators of other machines, ways to slip your code in and out of an emulation mode. It had all these kinds of things and not one bug ever found. Not one bug in the hardware, not one bug in the software. And you just can&#8217;t find a product like that nowadays. But, you see, I had it so intense in my head, and the reason for that was largely because it was part of me. Everything in there had to be so important to me. This computer was me. And everything had to be as perfect as could be made. And I had a lot going against me because I didn&#8217;t have a computer to compile my code, my software. </p>
</blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[</p>
<p>For nearly a decade, I&#8217;ve had a plaque bearing that question on my desk. </p>
<p>I think the question is valuable because it goes directly to motive. It&#8217;s also a deliciously contextual question &#8212; it means something different every minute, depending on what you&#8217;re up to. Here are a few scattered examples: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Why am I doing this job?&quot;</strong> Is it because someone, or society, told me that this was &quot;success&quot; (see <a href="http://herbsutter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!2D4327CC297151BB!143.entry">last week&#8217;s Friday Thought</a>)? Because it&#8217;s a way to make ends meet? Because I really enjoy it? Because this is a fun and cohesive team? Because I&#8217;m too tired to look for another job? Because I don&#8217;t think I could make it at a job I&#8217;d actually like to do?  </li>
<li><strong>&quot;Why am I writing the code this way?&quot;</strong> Is it because someone told me to, even though I don&#8217;t completely understand the reason? Because it&#8217;s the right way? Because I&#8217;m under time pressure and plan to fix it later? Because it&#8217;s a short cut and I don&#8217;t care about this product? Because I haven&#8217;t looked in <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/">Knuth&#8217;s</a> classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Computer-Programming-Volumes-Boxed/dp/0201485419">The Art of Computer Programming</a> to see if there&#8217;s already a known better structure or algorithm? Because I&#8217;m tired or distracted? Or because of something else?  </li>
<li><strong>&quot;Why did I fail to show appreciation for a friend&#8217;s help?&quot;</strong> Is it because I failed to realize how much they helped me, and at what cost to themselves? Because I was too absorbed/tired/stressed/distracted with just my own troubles? Because I care, but repeatedly failed to show it when it mattered? Because perhaps I actually do need to care more about other people and actively take an interest in them? Because of some combination of the above, and/or possibly more reasons?  </li>
<li><strong>&quot;Why am I driving to the store?&quot;</strong> Is it because that&#8217;s what everyone does? Because it&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve always done? Because I don&#8217;t have time to walk or bike (and if so, why not)? Because the groceries are too heavy/bulky to carry back? Because I haven&#8217;t thought of riding a bike in years?  </li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nobody&#8217;s perfect. I&#8217;ve wrestled with these and other questions, as I&#8217;m sure you do too, and try to improve a little every day and every year. </p>
<p>Being intentional is more than just about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_programming">programming</a>. We can get there if we keep trying.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I reread an old classic SF novel, and noticed some remarkable details in this passing comment by one character about the fictional 21st-century Utopia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;&#8230; there are too many distractions and entertainments. Do you realize that <em>every day</em> something like five hundred hours of radio and TV pour out over the various channels? If you went without sleep and did nothing else, you could follow less than a twentieth of the entertainment that&#8217;s available at the turn of a switch! No wonder people are becoming passive sponges &#8212; absorbing but never creating. Did you know that the <em>average</em> viewing time per person is now three hours a day? Soon people won&#8217;t be living their own lives any more. It will be a full-time job keeping up with the various family serials on TV!&quot;
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.clarkefoundation.org/acc/biography.php"><u><font color="#669966">Arthur C. Clarke</font></u></a>, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=childhood's+end+clarke"><u><font color="#669966">Childhood&#8217;s End</font></u></a></em>, 1953</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, in this passing reference Clarke probably wasn&#8217;t trying to make a serious prediction. Nevertheless, Sir Arthur&#8217;s astute understanding of the future growth and effects of TV is impressive, all the more so given TV&#8217;s primitive state when he wrote that in 1953.
</p>
<p><strong>Some perspective.</strong> According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_television"><u><font color="#669966">Wikipedia</font></u></a> and <a href="http://www.terramedia.co.uk/Chronomedia/years/1953.htm"><u><font color="#669966">TerraMedia</font></u></a>, in 1953 the first commercial TV licenses were granted in the states of Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, and South Dakota. Canada had only just begun its first regular TV transmissions the year before, and the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Wyoming wouldn&#8217;t issue their own first licenses until 1954. 1953 also saw the first TV coverage of the Academy Awards, and the launch of <em>TV Guide</em>.
</p>
<p><strong>How did Clarke do?</strong> With the benefit of hindsight, let&#8217;s see:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Three hours a day? </em>Right on: A recent global study reported that the average TV viewing time per person worldwide is just over three hours per day. In the United States, it&#8217;s four and a half hours per day. The Japanese top the list at five hours per day.
</li>
<li><em>500 hours of content per day? </em>Far more: At 16 hours per day, that would equal a mere 30 radio and TV stations. In 2006 the United States alone exceeded 2,200 TV stations and 13,700 radio stations. [<a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html"><u><font color="#669966">CIA factbook</font></u></a>] That&#8217;s not counting programming on &quot;channels&quot; like <a href="http://www.p.comcast.net/m/p/com/mic/index.asp?CMP=KNC-1TO1Q4MSNSRCH020"><u><font color="#669966">On Demand</font></u></a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/"><u><font color="#669966">YouTube</font></u></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we often say today, &quot;Who knew?&quot; In this case, Sir Arthur did. Last month he turned 89, and his literary output is still going strong. Hats off to the man!</p>
