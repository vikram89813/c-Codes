								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t get to Europe very often apart from ISO C++ standards meetings, but this spring I&#8217;ve been able to accept invitations for two English-language European events in the last week of April. If you&#8217;re interested in attending, please check out the links, and I look forward to meeting and re-meeting many of you there.</p>
<h3>Tue-Thu Apr 25-27: High-Performance and Low-Latency C++ (Stockholm)</h3>
<p>On April 25-27, I&#8217;ll be in Stockholm (Kista) giving a three-day seminar on <strong><a href="https://www.alfasoft.com/en/events/intel/578-high-performance-and-low-latency-c-with-herb-sutter.html">&#8220;High-Performance and Low-Latency C++.&#8221;</a></strong> This contains updated and new material that reflects the latest C++ standards and compilers, with a focus to using modern C++11/14/17 effectively on modern hardware and memory architectures.</p>
<p>Note that the class size is limited to about 100, so that I&#8217;ll be able to interact with most attendees directly. Registration just opened recently and hasn&#8217;t been widely publicized yet, but today I was told that it&#8217;s already over 1/3 full. So if you or your colleagues might be interested in attending, please check out the link above; for group registrations, please contact Alfasoft directly.</p>
<p>Here is the summary, below; for a more detailed topic breakdown see the link above.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Performance and efficiency are C++’s bread and butter, and they matter more than ever on modern hardware: In processors, single-threaded performance improvements are slowing down (unless your code is parallel); in Internet of Things, we are often asked to do more work with less hardware; and in cloud computing, processor/hardware time is often the major component of cost and so making code twice as efficient often means saving close to half the processing cost. Today, getting the highest performance and the lowest latency on modern hardware often means being aware of the hardware in ways that most other programming languages can’t – from hardware caches where simply arranging our data in the right order can give 50x speedups with otherwise identical code, to hardware parallelism where using parallel algorithms turns on high-performance parallel and vector processor hardware that otherwise sits idle.</p>
<p>Additionally, low latency increasingly matters at all scales: In user interfaces, low latency means responsive apps and productive users without the dreaded “wait…” donut; in financial trading, low latency regularly saves large amounts of cash; in embedded real-time systems, low latency is crucial to meeting deadlines and can even save lives. Today, this makes concurrency more important than ever, because it delivers two things: It hides latencies we have to deal with and cannot remove, from disk I/O latency to speed-of-light network latency; and it makes our code responsive by not introducing needless latencies of our own even when we’re not hiding someone else’s latency.</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>This intensive three day course will provide developers with the knowledge and skills required to write high-performance and low-latency code on today’s modern systems using modern C++11/14/17. During the training you’ll learn how to get the highest performance and the lowest latency on modern hardware in ways that are unique to C++, including how to arrange data to use hardware caches effectively, and how to use standard and your own custom-written parallel algorithms to harness high-performance parallel and vector processor hardware to compute results faster. You’ll also learn how to manage latency for responsive apps and for real-time systems, and techniques to hide the underlying latencies we have to deal with and cannot remove such as disk and network latency, and to make your own code responsive by not introducing needless latencies in your own code.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Sat Apr 29: ACCU closing keynote (Bristol)</h3>
<p>Next, I&#8217;ll be heading to Bristol to catch the end of the ACCU 2017 conference, and give the closing talk on <strong><a href="https://conference.accu.org/site/stories/2017/sessions.html#XSomethingsNewincpp">&#8220;Something(s) New in C++.&#8221;</a></strong> No, the title is not intentionally a tease; it&#8217;s just that I have several topics available, and I won&#8217;t be sure until about a month before the event which will be the best one to speak about. Here is the current abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>By the time the ACCU 2017 conference begins, C++17 is expected to be technically complete and in its final approval ballot. What comes next? Will C++ continue growing forever? Can C++ code be simplified? This is a brand-new talk of material I’ve never given before, in which I’ll present one (or more) of three proposals I’m personally working on to further improve C++ post-C++17. All follow a common theme – adding a strategic language and/or library feature to C++ that leads to significant, and sometimes dramatic, simplification of real-world C++ code. I’ll pick which one (or more) of those topics to present sometime in March.</p></blockquote>
<p>What I can say is that, whichever topic it ends up being, it&#8217;ll be something you haven&#8217;t seen before that&#8217;s forward-looking and aimed directly toward making C++ code simpler and easier&#8230; and of course without compromising C++&#8217;s model of efficient machine-near abstraction.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing many of you in Europe this spring.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t often link to other articles, but this one is worth reading.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://sealedabstract.com/rants/why-mobile-web-apps-are-slow/"><span style="font-size:14pt;">Why mobile web apps are slow</span></a></p>
<p>by Drew Crawford</p>
<p>… So if you are trying to figure out exactly what brand of crazy all your native developer friends are on for continuing to write the evil native applications on the cusp of the open web revolution, or whatever, then bookmark this page, make yourself a cup of coffee, clear an afternoon, find a comfy chair, and then we&#8217;ll both be ready.<span style="font-size:14pt;"><br />
</span></p></blockquote>
<p>He offers data (imagine!) to justly debunk many common memes and &#8220;easy answers&#8221; that routinely litter HN/Reddit/Slashdot comment threads. The piece is also often subtly (and intentionally) hilarious – do watch for the subtle humor, not just the obvious wit.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be distracted by the author&#8217;s viewpoint and emphasis on &#8220;iOS and Javascript&#8221; development – the article covers lots of important ground, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing for ARM vs. x86;</li>
<li>developing for desktop vs. mobile;</li>
<li>managed vs. native code performance;</li>
<li>JIT issues vs. inherent language design tensions;</li>
<li>why garbage collection is not at all the panacea it&#8217;s often billed to be and often needs to be emphatically avoided (did you realize Apple already jettisoned GC?); and</li>
<li>as many of you know already, why if you&#8217;re serious about performance you&#8217;ll be <em>seriously</em> serious about memory usage and access patterns as a first-order issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree with most of it, and not just because he quotes from my <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/04/02/reader-qa-when-will-better-jits-save-managed-code">When Will Better JITs Save Managed Code</a> blog post from last year.</p>
<p>Recommended.</p>
<h3>Spoilers</h3>
<p>A few takeaways from the conclusion (spoiler alert):</p>
<blockquote><p>Garbage collection is exponentially bad in a memory-constrained environment. It is way, way worse than it is in desktop-class or server-class environments.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Every competent mobile developer, whether they use a GCed environment or not, spends a great deal of time thinking about the memory performance of the target device</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>JavaScript, as it currently exists, is fundamentally opposed to even allowing developers to think about the memory performance of the target device</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If they did change their minds and allowed developers to think about memory, experience suggests this is a technically hard problem.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>asm.js show some promise, but even if they win you will be using C/C++ or similar &#8220;backwards&#8221; language as a frontend, rather than something dynamic like JavaScript</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bjarne Stroustrup wrote the following a few minutes ago on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/?fromgroups#!searchin/concepts/goto$20dijkstra/concepts/IAHQkYcbCDc/nm8W86ozXQYJ">concepts mailing list</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me take this opportunity to remind people that</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;being able to do something is not sufficient reason for doing it&quot; and</li>
<li>&quot;being able to do every trick is not a feature but a bug&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>For the latter, remember Dijkstra&#8217;s famous &quot;Goto considered harmful&quot; paper. The point was not that the &quot;new features&quot; (loop constructs) could do every goto trick better/simpler, but that some of those tricks should be avoided to simplify good programming.</p>
<p>Concepts and concepts lite are meant to make good generic programming simpler. They are not meant to be a drop-in substitute for every metaprogramming and macroprogramming trick. If you are an expert, and if in your expert opinion you and your users really need those tricks, you can still use them, but we need to make many (most) uses of templates easier to get right, so that they can become more mainstream. That where concepts and concept lite fits in.</p>
<p>Some of you may find this hard to believe, but &quot;back then&quot; there was quite serious opposition to function declarations because &quot;they restricted the way functions could be used and the way separate compilation could be used&quot; and also serious opposition to virtual functions &quot;because pointers to functions are so much more flexible.&quot; I see concepts lite (and concepts) in the same light as goto/for, unchecked-function-arguments/function-declarations, pointers-to-functions/abstract-classes.</p>

<p>From the post:</p>
<blockquote>

<p><em>We’ve been telling people to disable Java for years. … We have confirmed that VU#625617 can be used to reliably execute code on Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms.

<blockquote>
<p>Some people have asked whether last week’s and similar recent Java vulnerabilities are actually C or C++ vulnerabilities – because, like virtually all modern systems software, Java is implemented in C and C++.</p>
<p>The answer is no, these particular exploits are pure Java. Some other exploits have indeed used vulnerabilities in Java’s native C code implementation, but the major vulnerabilities in the news lately are in Java itself, and they enable portable exploits on any operating system with a single program. …</p>

<p>Some other C++ experts who have better sense than I do won’t add the following bit publicly, but I can’t help myself: Insert “write once, pwn everywhere” joke here…</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On yesterday’s thread, I just wrote in a comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@Jon: Yes, C++ is complex and the complexity is largely because of C compatibility. I agree with Bjarne that there’s a small language struggling to get out — I’ve participated in private experiments to specify such a language, and you can do it in well under half the complexity of C++ without losing the expressivity and flexibility of C++. However, it does require changes to syntax (mainly) and semantics (secondarily) that amount to making it a new language, which makes it a massive breaking change for programs (where existing code doesn’t compile and would need to be rewritten manually or with a tool) and programmers (where existing developers need retraining). That’s a very big tradeoff. So just as C++ ‘won’ in the 90s because of its own strengths plus its C compatibility, C++11 is being adopted because of its own strengths plus its C++98 compatibility. At the end of the day compatibility continues to be a very strong force and advantage that isn’t lightly tossed aside to “improve” things. However, it’s still worthwhile and some interesting things may come of it. Stay tuned, but expect (possible) news in years rather than months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That reminded me of a snippet from the September 2012 issues of CACM. When I first read it, I thought it was so worthwhile that I made a magnified copy and pasted it on the window outside my office at work – it’s still there. The lightly annotated conclusion is shown here.</p>
<p><a href="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/image.png"><img title="image" style="border-top:0;border-right:0;background-image:none;border-bottom:0;float:right;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;margin:10px 0 10px 10px;border-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;" border="0" alt="image" align="right" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/image_thumb.png?w=429&#038;h=1492" width="429" height="1492" /></a>The article itself was about a different technology, but the Lessons Learned conclusion remind us of the paramount importance of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backward compatibility with simple migration path (“compat”). That’s what keeps you “in the ecosystem.”</strong> If you don’t have such compatibility, don’t expect wide adoption unless there are hugely compelling reasons to put up with the breaking change. It’s roughly the same kind of ecosystem change for programmers to go from Language X to Language Y as for users to go from Platform X to Platform Y (e.g., Windows to Mac, iPhone to Android) – in each case you have a lot of relearning, and you lose understood tools and services some of which have replacements and some of which don’t.</li>
<li><strong>Focusing on complete end-to-end solutions (“SFE” or scenario-focused engineering).</strong> This is why it’s important not to ship just a bunch of individual features, because that can leave holes where Steps 1, 2, and 4 of an end-to-end experience are wonderful but Step 3 is awkward, unreliable, or incomplete, which renders much of the good work in the other steps unuseful since they can’t be used as much or possibly at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/image3.png"><img title="image" style="border-top:0;border-right:0;background-image:none;border-bottom:0;float:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;margin:0 auto 10px;border-left:0;display:block;padding-right:0;" border="0" alt="image" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/image_thumb.png?w=513&#038;h=146" width="513" height="146" /></a></p>
<p>Almost right, and we have already reached that.</p>
<p>I said something similar to the above, but with two important differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>I said hardware “threads,” not only hardware “cores” – it was about the <strong>amount of hardware parallelism </strong>available on a mainstream system. </li>
<li>What I gave was a min/max <strong>range estimate of roughly 16 to 256 (the latter being threads)</strong> under different sets of assumptions. </li>
</ol>
<p>So: Was I was right about 2013 estimates?</p>
<p>Yes, pretty much, and in fact we already reached or exceeded that in 2011 and 2012:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower estimate line: In 2011 and 2012 parts, Intel Core i7 Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge are delivering almost the expected lower baseline, and offering 8-way and 12-way parallelism = 4-6 cores x 2 hardware threads per core. </li>
<li>Upper estimate line: In 2012, as mentioned in the article (which called it Larrabee, now known as MIC or Xeon Phi) is delivering 200-way to 256-way parallelism = 50-64 cores x 4 hardware threads per core. Also, in 2011 and 2012, GPUs have since emerged into more mainstream use for computation (GPGPU), and likewise offer massive compute parallelism, such as 1,536-way parallelism on a machine having a single NVidia Tesla card. </li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, mainstream machines do in fact have examples of both ends of the “16 to 256 way parallelism” range. And beyond the upper end of the range, in fact, for those with higher-end graphics cards.</p>
<p>For more on these various kinds of compute cores and threads, see also my article <strong><a href="https://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle/">Welcome to the Jungle</a></strong>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Longer answer follows:</p>
<p>Here’s the main part from article, <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/parallel/design-for-manycore-systems/219200099?pgno=3"><strong>“Design for Manycore Systems”</strong></a> (August 11, 2009). Remember this was written over three years ago – in the Time Before iPad, when Android was under a year old:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><font style="font-weight:normal;">How Much Scalability Does Your Application Need?</font></h3>
<p>So how much parallel scalability should you aim to support in the application you‘re working on today, assuming that it&#8217;s compute-bound already or you can add killer features that are compute-bound and also amenable to parallel execution? The answer is that <strong>you want to match your application&#8217;s scalability to the amount of hardware parallelism in the target hardware that will be available during your application&#8217;s expected production or shelf lifetime. As shown in Figure 4, that equates to the number of hardware threads you expect to have on your end users&#8217; machines.</strong> </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/twimgs.com/ddj/images/article/2009/0908/090811ec_f4.gif" /></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 4</b>: How much concurrency does your program need in order to exploit given hardware? </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that YourCurrentApplication 1.0 will ship next year (mid-2010), and you expect that it&#8217;ll be another 18 months until you ship the 2.0 release (early 2012) and probably another 18 months after that before most users will have upgraded (mid-2013). Then you&#8217;d be interested in judging what will be the likely mainstream hardware target up to mid-2013. </p>
<p><strong>If we stick with &quot;just more of the same&quot;</strong> as in Figure 2&#8217;s extrapolation, we&#8217;d expect aggressive early hardware adopters to be running 16-core machines (possibly double that if they&#8217;re aggressive enough to run dual-CPU workstations with two sockets), and <strong>we&#8217;d likely expect most general mainstream users to have 4-, 8- or maybe a smattering of 16-core machines</strong> (accounting for the time for new chips to be adopted in the marketplace). <em><font color="#c0504d">[[Note: I often get lazy and say “core” to mean all hardware parallelism. In context above and below, it’s clear we’re talking about “cores and threads.”]]</font></em></p>
<p>But what if the gating factor, parallel-ready software, goes away? Then CPU vendors would be free to take advantage of <strong>options like the one-time 16-fold hardware parallelism jump</strong> illustrated in Figure 3, and we get an envelope like that shown in Figure 5. </p>
<p><img style="float:none;margin-left:auto;display:block;margin-right:auto;" src="https://i2.wp.com/twimgs.com/ddj/images/article/2009/0908/090811ec_f5.gif" /></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 5</b>: Extrapolation of “more of the same big cores” and “possible one-time switch to 4x smaller cores plus 4x threads per core” (not counting some transistors being used for other things like on-chip GPUs). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, let’s look at the lower baseline, ‘most general mainstream users to have [4-16 way parallelism] machines in 2013’? So where are were in 2012 today for mainstream CPU hardware parallelism? Well, Intel Core i7 (e.g., Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge) are typically in the 4 to 6 core range – which, <strong>with hyperthreading == hardware threads, means 8 to 12 hardware threads</strong>.</p>
<p>Second, what about the higher potential line for 2013? As noted above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel’s Xeon Phi (then Larrabee) is now delivering 50-64 cores x 4 threads = 200 to 256-way parallelism. That’s no surprise, because this article’s upper line was based on exactly the Larrabee data point (see quote below). </li>
<li>GPUs already blow the 256 upper bound away – any machine with a two-year-old Tesla has 1,536-way parallelism for programs (including mainstream programs like DVD encoders) that can harness the GPU. </li>
</ul>
<p>So not only did we already reach the 2013 upper line early, in 2012, but we already exceeded it for applications that can harness the GPU for computation.</p>
<p>As I said in the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe either the bottom line or the top line is the exact truth, but as long as sufficient parallel-capable software comes along, the truth will probably be somewhere in between, especially if we have processors that offer a mix of large- and small-core chips, or that use some chip real estate to bring GPUs or other devices on-die. That&#8217;s more hardware parallelism, and sooner, than most mainstream developers I&#8217;ve encountered expect. </p>
<p>Interestingly, though, we already noted two current examples: Sun&#8217;s Niagara, and Intel&#8217;s Larrabee, already provide double-digit parallelism in mainstream hardware via smaller cores with four or eight hardware threads each. <strong>&quot;Manycore&quot; chips, or perhaps more correctly &quot;manythread&quot; chips, are just waiting to enter the mainstream</strong>. Intel could have built a nice 100-core part in 2006. The gating factor is the software that can exploit the hardware parallelism; that is, the gating factor is you and me. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Topics Scott raises include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2:00</strong> Scott mentions he has used C++ in the past. C++ has changed. We still call it C++, but it’s a very different language now.</li>
<li><strong>5:30</strong> (Why) do we care about performance any more?</li>
<li><strong>10:00</strong> What’s this GPGPU thing? Think of your GPU as your modern 80387.</li>
<li><strong>13:45</strong> C++ is having a resurgence. Where is C++ big?</li>
<li><strong>18:00</strong> Why not just use one language? or, What is C++ good at? Efficient abstraction and portability.</li>
<li><strong>21:45</strong> Programmers have a responsibility to support the business. Avoid the pitfall of speeds &amp; feeds.</li>
<li><strong>24:00</strong> My experience with my iPad, my iPhone, and my Slate 7 with Win8.</li>
<li><strong>28:45</strong> We’re in two election seasons – (a) political and (b) technology (Nexus, iPad Mini, Surface, …). Everyone is wallpapering the media with ads (some of them attack ads), and vying for customer votes/$$, and seeing who’s going to be the winner.</li>
<li><strong>35:00</strong> Natural user interfaces – we get so easily used to touch that we paw all screen, and Scott’s son gets so used to saying “Xbox pause” that anything that doesn’t respond is “broken.”</li>

<p>This has been a phenomenal year for C++, since C++11’s publication just 12 months ago. And yesterday was a great day for C++.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had the privilege of announcing much of what Microsoft and the industry have been working on over the past year.</p>
<h2>(minor) C++ at Microsoft</h2>
<p>On September 12, we shipped VC++ 2012 with the complete C++11 standard library, and adding support for C++11 range-<em>for</em>, <em>enum class</em>, <em>override </em>and <em>final</em>. Less than two months later, yesterday we announced and shipped the November 2012 CTP, a compiler add-in to VC++ 2012 adding C++11 variadic templates, uniform initialization and <em>initializer_list</em>s, delegating constructors, function template default arguments, explicit conversion operators, and raw string literals. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2012/11/02/visual-c-c-11-and-the-future-of-c.aspx"><strong>Details here</strong></a>, and <a href="http://aka.ms/vc-ctp"><strong>download here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Note that this is just the first batch of additional C++11 features. Expect further announcements and deliveries in the first half of 2013.</p>
<h2>(major) C++ across the industry</h2>
<p>Interest and investment in C++ continues to accelerate across the software world.</p>
<ul>
<li>ISO C++ standardization is <strong><a href="http://isocpp.org/std/status">accelerating</a></strong>. Major companies are dedicating more people and resources to C++ standardization than they have in years. Over the next 24 months, we plan to ship three Technical Specifications and a new C++ International Standard.</li>
<li>C++ now has a home on the web at <a href="http://isocpp.org"><strong>isocpp.org</strong></a>. Launched yesterday, it both aggregates the best C++ content and hosts new content itself, including Bjarne Stroustrup’s new <a href="http://isocpp.org/tour">Tour of C++</a> and Scott Meyers’ new <a href="http://isocpp.org/blog/2012/11/universal-references-in-c11-scott-meyers">Universal References article</a>.</li>
<li>We now have a <a href="http://isocpp.org/about"><strong>Standard C++ Foundation</strong></a>. Announced yesterday, it is already funded by the largest companies in the industry down to startups, financial institutions to universities, book publishers to other consortia, with more members joining weekly. For the first time in C++’s history since AT&amp;T relinquished control of the language, we have an entity – a trade organization – that exists exclusively to promote Standard C++ on all compilers and platforms, and companies are funding it because the world runs on C++, and investing in Standard C++ is good business.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/11/03/our-industry-is-young-again-and-its-all-about-ui/">This is an exciting time to be part of our industry</a>, on any OS and using any language. It’s especially an exciting time to be involved with C++ on all compilers and platforms.</p>
<p>Thank you all, whatever platform and language you use, for being part of it.</p>

<p>At the end of the Monday afternoon session, I will be making a special announcement related to Standard C++ on all platforms. Be there to hear the details, and to receive an extra perk that’s being reserved for <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/">C&amp;B 2012</a> attendees only.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: We sometimes record sessions and make them freely available online via Channel 9, and we intend to do that again this year for some selected sessions. <strong>However, this session is for C&amp;B attendees only and will not be recorded.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://cppandbeyond2012.eventbrite.com/">Registration is open until Wednesday</a> and the event is pretty full but a few spaces are still available. I’m looking forward to seeing many of you there for a top-notch C++ conference full of fresh new current material – I’ve seen Andrei’s and Scott’s talk slides too, and I think this C&amp;B is going to be the best one yet.</p>
<p>You’ll leave exhausted, but with a full brain and quite likely a big silly grin as you think about all the ways to use the material right away on your current project back home.</p>

We got a bigger venue this time, but as I write this the event is currently almost 75% full with five weeks to go.</p>
<p>I know, I’ve already posted <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2012/03/26/session-topic-you-dont-know-and/">three</a> <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2012/05/28/two-sessions-c-concurrency-and-parallelism-2012-state-of-the-art-and-standard/">sessions</a> and a <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2012/04/30/panel-modern-c-clean-safe-and-faster-than-ever/">panel</a>. But there’s just so much about C++11 to cover, so here’s a fourth brand-new session I’ll do at C&amp;B 2012 that goes deeper on its topic than I’ve ever been willing to go before.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2012/06/29/new-session-atomic-weapons-the-c11-memory-model-and-modern-hardware/"><font>atomic&lt;&gt; Weapons: The C++11 Memory Model and Modern Hardware</font></a></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>This session in one word: <i><strong>Deep.</strong></i> </p>
<p>It’s a session that includes topics I’ve publicly said for years is Stuff You Shouldn’t Need To Know and I Just Won’t Teach, but it’s becoming achingly clear that people do need to know about it. Achingly, heartbreakingly clear, because some hardware incents you to pull out the big guns to achieve top performance, and C++ programmers just are so addicted to full performance that they’ll reach for the big red levers with the flashing warning lights. Since we can’t keep people from pulling the big red levers, we’d better document the A to Z of what the levers actually do, so that people don’t <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scram">SCRAM</a> unless they really, really, really meant to. </p>
<p>This session covers: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The facts: </strong>The C++11 memory model and what it requires you to do to make sure your code is correct and stays correct. We’ll include clear answers to several FAQs: “how do the compiler and hardware cooperate to remember how to respect these rules?”, “what is a race condition?”, and the ageless one-hand-clapping question “how is a race condition like a debugger?” </li>
<li><strong>The tools:</strong> The deep interrelationships and fundamental tradeoffs among mutexes, atomics, and fences/barriers. I’ll try to convince you why standalone memory barriers are bad, and why barriers should always be associated with a specific load or store. </li>
<li><strong>The unspeakables: </strong>I’ll grudgingly and reluctantly talk about the Thing I Said I’d Never Teach That Programmers Should Never Need To Now: relaxed atomics. Don’t use them! If you can avoid it. But here’s what you need to know, even though it would be nice if you didn’t need to know it. </li>
<li><strong>The rapidly-changing hardware reality: </strong>How locks and atomics map to hardware instructions on ARM and x86/x64, and throw in POWER and Itanium for good measure – and I’ll cover how and why the answers are actually different last year and this year, and how they will likely be different again a few years from now. We’ll cover how the latest CPU and GPU hardware memory models are rapidly evolving, and how this directly affects C++ programmers. </li>
<li><strong>Coda: Volatile and “compiler-only” memory barriers.</strong> It’s important to understand exactly what atomic and volatile are and aren’t for. I’ll show both why they’re both utterly unrelated (they have exactly zero overlapping uses, really) and yet are fundamentally related when viewed from the perspective of talking about the memory model. Also, people keep seeing and asking about “compiler-only” memory barriers and when to use them – they do have a valid-though-rare use, but it’s not the use that most people are trying to use them for, so beware! </li>
</ul>
<p>For me, this is going to be the deepest and most fun C&amp;B yet. At previous C&amp;Bs I’ve spoken about not only code, but also meta topics like design and C++’s role in the marketplace. This time it looks like all my talks will be back to Just Code. Fun times!</p>

They made a nice recording and it’s now available online here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facebook Engineering</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151029515183109"><strong>Title: Herb Sutter: Welcome to the Jungle</strong></a></p>
<p>In the twilight of Moore&#8217;s Law, the transitions to multicore processors, GPU computing, and HaaS cloud computing are not separate trends, but aspects of a single trend—mainstream computers from desktops to &#8216;smartphones&#8217; are being permanently transformed into heterogeneous supercomputer clusters. Henceforth, a single compute-intensive application will need to harness different kinds of cores, in immense numbers, to get its job done. &#8212; The free lunch is over. Now welcome to the hardware jungle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/Welcome_to_the_Jungle_-_FB-pdf/">slides are available here</a>. (There doesn’t seem to be a link to the slides on the page itself as I write this.)</p>
<p>For those interested in a longer version, in April I gave a 105-minute + Q&amp;A version of this talk in Kansas City at Perceptive, also <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/04/23/talk-video-welcome-to-the-jungle/">available online where I posted before</a>.</p>
<h3>A word about “cluster in a box”</h3>
<p>I should have remembered that describing a PC as a “heterogeneous cluster in a box” is a big red button for people, in particular because “cluster” implies “parts can fail and program should continue.” So in the Q&amp;A, one commenter made the point that I should have mentioned reliability is an issue.</p>
<p>As I answered there, I half agree – it’s true but it’s only half the story, and it doesn’t affect the programming model (see more below). One of the slides I omitted to shorten this version of the talk highlighted that there are actually two issues when you go from “Disjoint (tightly coupled)” to “Disjoint (loosely coupled)”: <strong>reliability</strong> <em>and </em><strong>latency</strong>, and both are important. (I also mentioned this in the <a href="https://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle/">original WttJ article</a> this is based on; just search for “reliability.”)</p>
<p>Even after the talk, I still got strong resistance along the lines that, ‘no, you obviously don’t get it, latency isn’t a significant issue at all, reliability is the central issue and it kills your argument because it makes the model fundamentally different.’ Paraphrasing subsequent email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘A fundamental difference between distributed computing and single-box multiprocessing is that in the former case you don&#8217;t know whether a failure was a communication failure (i.e. the task was completed but communication failed) or a genuine failure to carry the task. (Hence all complicated two-phase commit protocols etc.) In contrast, in a single-box scenario you can know the box you&#8217;re on is working.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me respond further to this here, because clearly these guys know more about distributed systems than I do and I’m always happy to be educated, but I also think we have a disconnect on three things asserted above: It is not my understanding that reliability is more important than latency, or that apps have to distinguish comms failures from app exceptions, or that N-phase commit enters the picture.</p>
<p>First, I don’t agree with the assertion that reliability alone is what’s important, or that it’s more important than latency, for the following reason:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You can build reliable transports on top of unreliable ones.</strong> You do it through techniques like sequencing, redundancy, and retry. A classic example is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>, which delivers reliable communications over notoriously- and deliberately-unreliable IP which can drop and reorder packets as network nodes and communications paths keep madly appearing and reappearing like a herd of crazed Cheshire cats. We can and do build secure reliable global banking systems on that.</li>
<li><strong>Once you do that, you have turned a reliability issue into a performance (specifically latency) issue.</strong> Both reliability and latency are key issues when moving to loosely-coupled systems, but because you can turn the first into the second, it’s latency that is actually the more fundamental and important one – and the only one the developer needs to deal with.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to use compute clouds like Azure and AWS, you usually start with two basic pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>the queue(s), which you use to push the work items out/around and results back/around; and </li>
<li>an elastic set of compute nodes, each of which pulls work items from the queue and processes them.</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens when you encounter a reliability problem? A node can pull a work item but fail to complete it, for example if the node crashes or the system encounters a partial network outage or other communication problem.</p>
<p>Many modern systems already automatically recover and have another node re-pull the same work item to make sure each work item gets done even in the face of partial failures. From the app&#8217;s point of view, such <strong>failures just manifest as degraded performance (higher latency or time-to-solution) and therefore mainly affect the granularity of parallel work items</strong> – they have to be big enough to be worth sending elsewhere and so minimum size is directly proportional to latency so that the overheads do not dominate. They do not manifest as app-visible failures.</p>
<p>Yes, the elastic cloud implementation has to deal with things like network failures and retries. But no, this isn’t your problem; it’s not supposed to be your job to implement the elastic cloud, it’s supposed to be your job just to implement each node’s local logic and to create whatever queues you want and push your work item data into them.</p>
<p>Aside: Of course, as with any retry-based model, you have to make sure that a partly-executed work item doesn’t expose any partial side effects it shouldn’t, and normally you prevent that by doing the work in a transaction and rolling it back on failure, or in the extreme (not generally recommended but sometimes okay) resorting to compensating writes to back out partial work. </p>
<p>That covers everything except the comment about two-phase commit: Citing that struck me as odd because I haven’t heard much us of that kind of coupled approach in years. Perhaps I’m misinformed, but my impression of 2- or N-phase commit protocols was that they have some serious problems: </p>
<ul>
<li>They are inherently nonscalable. </li>
<li>They increase rather than decrease interdependencies in the system – even with heroic efforts like majority voting and such schemes that try to allow for subsets of nodes being unavailable, which always seemed fragile to me. </li>
<li>Also, I seem to remember that NPC is a blocking protocol, which if so is inherently anti-concurrency. One of the big realizations in modern mainstream concurrency in the past few years is that Blocking Is Nearly Always Evil. (I’m looking at you, <em>future.get()</em>, and this is why the committee is now considering adding the nonblocking <em>future.then()</em> as well.)</li>
</ul>
<p>So my impression is that these were primarily of historical interest – if they are still current in modern datacenters, I would appreciate learning more about it and seeing if I’m overly jaded about N-phase commit.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/GoingNative-2012/C-11-VC-11-and-Beyond">beating the drum this year</a> (see the last section of the talk) that the biggest problem facing C++ today is the lack of a large set of <em>de jure</em> and <em>de facto</em> standard libraries. My team at Microsoft just recently announced <strong><a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/04/30/c-libraries-casablanca/">Casablanca</a></strong>, a cloud-oriented C++ library and that we intend to open source, and we’re making other even bigger efforts that I hope will bear fruit and I’ll be able to share soon. But it can’t be just one company – many companies have already shared great open libraries on the past, but still more of us have to step up.</p>
<p>In that vein, I was extremely happy to see another effort come to fruition today. A few hours ago I was at Facebook to speak at their C++ day, and I got to be in the room when Andrei Alexandrescu dropped his arm to officially launch <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/folly-the-facebook-open-source-library/10150864656793920">Folly</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><font size="3"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/folly-the-facebook-open-source-library/10150864656793920">Folly: The Facebook Open Source Library</a></font></h4>
<p>by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/delong.j">Jordan DeLong</a> on Saturday, June 2, 2012 at 2:59pm ·</p>
<p>Facebook is built on open source from top to bottom, and could not exist without it. As engineers here, we use, contribute to, and release a lot of open source software, including pieces of our core infrastructure such as <a href="https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php">HipHop</a> and <a href="http://thrift.apache.org/">Thrift</a>.</p>
<p>But in our C++ services code, one clear bottleneck to releasing more work has been that any open sourced project needed to break dependencies on unreleased internal library code. To help solve that problem, today we open sourced an initial release of Folly, a collection of reusable C++ library artifacts developed and used at Facebook. This announcement was made at our C++ conference at Facebook in Menlo Park, CA.</p>
<p>Our primary aim with this &#8216;foolishness&#8217; is to create a solution that allows us to continue open sourcing parts of our stack without resorting to reinventing some of our internal wheels. And because Folly&#8217;s components typically perform significantly faster than counterparts available elsewhere, are easy to use, and complement existing libraries, we think C++ developers might find parts of this library interesting in their own right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrei announced that Folly stood for the <strong><font color="#0000ff">F</font></strong>acebook <strong><font color="#0000ff">O</font></strong>pen <strong><font color="#0000ff">Ll</font></strong>ibrar<strong><font color="#0000ff">y</font></strong>. He claimed it was a Welsh name, which is even funnier when said by a charming Romanian man.</p>
<p>Microsoft, and I personally, would like to congratulate Facebook on this release! Getting more high-quality open C++ libraries is a Good Thing, and I think it is safe to say that Casablanca and Folly are just the beginning. There’s a lot more coming&#160; across our industry this year. Stay tuned.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s time for, not one, but two brand-new, up-to-date talks on the state of the art of concurrency and parallelism in C++. I’m going to put them together <strong>especially and only for <em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/">C++ and Beyond 2012</a></em></strong>, and I’ll be giving them nowhere else this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><font size="3">C++ Concurrency – 2012 State of the Art (and Standard)</font></strong> </li>
<li><strong><font size="3">C++ Parallelism – 2012 State of the Art (and Standard)</font></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>And there’s a lot to tell. 2012 has already been a busy year for the pushing the boundaries of both “shipping-and-practical” and “proto-standard” concurrency and parallelism in C++:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In February</strong>, the <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/03/08/trip-report-february-2012-c-standards-meeting/">spring ISO C++ standards meeting</a> saw record attendance at 73 experts (normal is 50-55), and spent the full week primarily on new language and library proposals, with notable emphasis on the area of concurrency and parallelism. There was so much interest that I formed four Study Groups and appointed chairs: the largest on concurrency and parallelism (SG1, Hans Boehm), and three others on modules (SG2, Doug Gregor), filesystem (SG3, Beman Dawes), and networking (SG4, Kyle Kloepper). </li>
<li><strong>Three weeks ago</strong>, we hosted another three-day face-to-face meeting for SG1 and SG4 – and at nearly 40 people the SG1 attendance rivaled that of a normal full ISO C++ meeting, with a who’s-who of the world’s concurrency and parallelism experts in attendance and <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/04/06/we-want-await-a-c-talk-thats-applicable-to-c/">further proposal presentations</a> from companies like IBM, Intel, and Microsoft. There was so much interest that I had to form a new Study Group 5 for Transactional Memory (SG5), and appointed Michael Wong of IBM as chair. </li>
<li>Over the summer, we’ll all be working on updated proposals for the October ISO C++ meeting in Portland. </li>
</ul>
<p>Things are heating up, and we’re narrowing down which areas to focus on.</p>
<p>I’ve spoken and written on these topics before. Here’s what’s different about these talks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand new: </strong>This material goes beyond what I’ve written and taught about before in my <em>Effective Concurrency</em> articles and courses. </li>
<li><strong>Cutting-edge current:</strong> It covers the best-practices state of the art <strong>techniques</strong> and <strong>shipping tools</strong>, and what parts of that are standardized <strong>in C++11 already</strong> (the answer to that one may surprise you!) and what’s en route to <strong>near-term standardization</strong> and why, with coverage of the latest discussions. </li>
<li><strong>Mainstream hardware – many kinds of parallelism:</strong> What’s the relationship among <strong>multi-core</strong> CPUs, <strong>hardware threads</strong>, SIMD <strong>vector units</strong> (Intel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions">SSE</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">AVX</a>, ARM <a href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/neon.php">Neon</a>), and <strong>GPGPU </strong>(general-purpose computation on GPUs, which I covered at <em>C++ and Beyond 2011</em>)? Which are most interesting, what technologies are available now, and what’s being considered for near-term standardization? </li>
<li><strong>Blocking vs. non-blocking:</strong> What’s the difference between blocking and non-blocking styles, why on earth would you care, which kinds does C++11 support, and how are we looking at rounding it out in C++1<em>y</em>? </li>
<li><strong>Task and data parallelism:</strong> What’s the difference between task parallelism and data parallelism, which kind of of hardware does each allow you to exploit, and why? </li>
<li><strong>Work stealing: </strong>What’s the difference between thread pools and work stealing, what are the major flavors of work stealing, which of these (if any) does C++11 already support and is already shipping on some advanced commercial C++ compilers today (this answer will likely surprise you), and what needs to be done in the next round for a complete state-of-the-art parallelism story in C++1<em>y</em>? </li>
</ul>
<p>The answers all matter to you – even the ones not yet in the C++ standard – because they are real, available in shipping products, and affect how you design your software today.</p>
<p>This will be a broad and deep dive. At C++ and Beyond 2011, the <em>attendees</em> (audience!) included some of the world’s leading experts on parallelism and compilers. At these sessions of C&amp;B 2012, I expect anyone who wasn’t personally at the SG1 meeting this month, even world-class experts, will learn something new in these talks. I certainly did, and that’s why I’m motivated to turn the information into talks and share. This isn’t just cool stuff – it’s important and useful in production code today.</p>
<p>I hope to see many of you at C&amp;B 2012. I’m excited about these topics, and about Scott’s and Andrei’s new material – you just can’t get this stuff anywhere else.</p>
<p>Asheville is going to be blast. I can’t wait.</p>
<p>Herb</p>
<hr />
<p>P.S.: I haven’t seen this much attention and investment in C++ since last century – C++ conferences at record numbers, C++ compiler investments by the biggest companies in the industry (e.g., Clang), and much more that we’ve seen already…</p>
<p>… and a little bird tells me there’s a lot more major C++ news coming this year. Stay tuned, and fasten your seat belts. 2012 ain’t done yet, not by a long shot, and I’ll be able to say more about C++ as a whole (besides the specific topics mentioned above) for the first time at C&amp;B in August. I hope to see you there.</p>
<p>FYI, C&amp;B is already over 60% full, and early bird registration ends this Friday, June 1 – so <a href="http://cppandbeyond2012.eventbrite.com/">register today</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to know how to write cool tablet apps using Visual C++?</p>
<p>On May 18, Microsoft is hosting a <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Announcing-Building-Windows-8-Metro-Style-Apps-with-C-A-Free-Event">one-day free technical event for developers who want to write Metro apps for Windows 8 using Visual C++</a>. I’m giving the opening talk, and the rest of the day is full of useful technical information on everything from XAML and DirectX to networking and VC++ compiler flags.</p>
<p>Please note: This event is Windows-specific, and talks will use both portable ISO C++ as well as Visual C++-specific libraries and compiler extensions; for brevity these are being referred to as &quot;C++&quot; to highlight to a Microsoft-specific audience that that this day is about Visual C++, not about Visual C# or Visual Basic or JavaScript.</p>
<p>From the page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Join the Microsoft Visual C++ and Windows teams in Redmond on May 18, 2012 for a free, all-day event focused on building Windows 8 Metro style apps with C++.&#160; </p>
<p>These Windows-specific talks will use both portable ISO C++ and Visual C++-specific compiler extensions; for brevity below we&#8217;ll refer to both as &quot;C++&quot; (i.e., this day is about Visual C++, not Visual C# or JavaScript).</p>
<p>We will have pragmatic advice for every developer writing Metro style apps and games with XAML and/or DirectX and C++.</p>
<p><a href="https://win8.msregistration.com/default.aspx?ID=559a9ac4-96a6-46a1-b359-598e345d25be"><strong>Register now!</strong></a></p>
<p>Agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual C++ for Windows 8, Keynote by Herb Sutter</li>
<li>Building Windows 8 apps with XAML and C++</li>
<li>Building Windows 8 games with DirectX and C++</li>
<li>Introduction to the Windows Runtime Library&#160; (WRL)</li>
<li>Writing Connected apps: Writing networking code with C++</li>
<li>Combining XAML &amp; DirectX in a Metro style apps</li>
<li>Writing WinRT components to be consumed from any language</li>
<li>VC11 compiler flags for getting the most out of C++</li>
</ul>
<p>All sessions will be recorded and available for on demand viewing on C9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wish I’d blogged about it right away when it was announced a week or so ago, because registration filled immediately before I could blog it (I think on the first day), and then when the room was expanded it filled again right away again before I could blog about it. Then I procrastinated for a few days. You can still <a href="https://win8.msregistration.com/default.aspx?ID=559a9ac4-96a6-46a1-b359-598e345d25be">register here for the waitlist</a> to see it in person, but I have good news…</p>
<p><strong>All sessions will be broadcast livestream and then available for viewing on demand.</strong> If you’re halfway around the world, or just halfway across the country, it’s hard to fly somewhere for a one-day event anyway; thanks to livestream and on-demand, the Internet is our friend. I look forward to seeing and e-seeing many of you there.</p>

The goal is to find or develop modern C++ libraries that leverage C++11 features, and then submit the best for standardization.</p>
<p>Microsoft wants to do its part, and here’s a step in that direction.</p>
<p>Today I’m pleased to see Soma’s post about <strong><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2012/04/30/devlabs-c-cloud-services-and-you.aspx">“C++, Cloud Services, and You”</a></strong> announcing the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/casablanca"><strong>DevLabs release of Casablanca</strong></a>, a set of C++ libraries for Visual C++ users that start to bring the same modern conveniences already enjoyed by .NET and Node.js and Erlang users also to C++ developers on our local and cloud platforms, including modern C++ libraries for REST, HTTP, and JSON. From Soma’s announcement, adding my own <strong>emphasis </strong>and minor code edits:</p>
<blockquote><p>Historically, we’ve lacked such simple tools for developers using C++.  While there are multiple relevant native networking APIs (e.g. WinINet, WinHTTP, IXMLHttpRequest2, HTTP Server API), these are not optimized from a productivity perspective for <strong>consuming and implementing RESTful cloud services using modern C++</strong>.  They don’t compose particularly well with code based on the standard C++ libraries, and they don’t <strong>take advantage of modern C++ language features and practices</strong> in their programming models.</p>
<p>This is where “Casablanca” comes in.  “Casablanca” is a set of libraries for C++ developers, taking advantage of some recent standard language features already available through Visual Studio.</p>
<p><strong>“Casablanca” aims to make it significantly easier for C++ coders to consume and implement RESTful services.  It builds on lessons from .NET, from Node.js, from Erlang, and from other influencers to create a modern model that is meant to be easy to program while still being scalable, composable, and flexible.</strong></p>
<p>As an example, here’s a snippet that uses the client HTTP library to search Bing for my name and output the results to the console:</p>
<pre>    http_client bing( L"http://www.bing.com/search" );

    bing.request( methods::GET, L"?q=S.Somasegar" )
        .then( []( http_response response ) {
            cout &lt;&lt; "HTML SOURCE:" &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; response.to_string() &lt;&lt; endl; })
        .wait();</pre>
<p>and here’s a simple web listener hosted in a console application:</p>
<pre>    listener::create( argv[1], []( http_request req ) {
            req.reply( status_codes::OK, "Namaste!" ); })
        .listen( []{ fgetc( stdin ); } )
        .wait();</pre>
<p>For those of you looking to build Azure services in C++, “Casablanca” comes with a Visual Studio wizard to set up everything up correctly.  You can target both Web and Worker roles, and you can access Azure storage using the built-in C++ library bindings. […] Taking C++ to the cloud with “Casablanca” is another exciting step in that journey.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today’s Casablanca release is as a DevLabs project, to get usability feedback and to eventually support these features in the full Visual C++ product. If you’re interested in using C++ to consume and implement cloud services, and sharing what kind of support you want and whether you think Casablanca is on the right track, please let us know in the <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/casablanca/threads">forums</a>.</p>
<p>Looking beyond Visual C++, one piece of Casablanca is already being proposed for standardization, namely the “future.then” nonblocking continuations that are required to be able to write highly responsive composable libraries – you really want all async libraries to talk about their work using the same type, and std::future already gives half of what we need (blocking synchronization) and just needs the non-blocking part too. Also being proposed as an optional layer on top of “future.then” is an “await” style of language support to make the async operations as easy to express and use in C++ as in any of the best languages in the world.</p>
<p>Note that there are other C++ libraries too for several of these facilities. Repeating what I said at GoingNative, we (Microsoft) don’t care whose libraries get standardized – whether ones we contribute or someone else’s. We care most that <em>there be</em> standard C++ libraries for these modern uses, starting with the most basic “future.then” support, and to encourage all companies and groups who have libraries in these important spaces to contribute them and take the best and make them available to C++ developers on all platforms. This is a small step in that process.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m seeing many younger programmers picking up C++. The average age at C++ events over the past year has been declining rapidly as the audience sizes grow with more and younger people in addition to the C++ veterans.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://www.computeach.co.uk/IT-news/IT-Computer-Technology-News/IT-industry-news-Six-year-old-computer-whiz-aims-for-record/801352474">this one just beats all</a> [Facebook link added]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A six-year-old child from Bangladesh is hoping to be officially recognised as the world&#8217;s youngest computer programmer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Wasik-Farhan-Roopkotha/100000454476401">Wasik Farhan-Roopkotha</a> showed an aptitude for computing at an early age and started typing in Microsoft Word at just three years old, BBC News reports.</p>
<p>The precocious youngster was programming game emulators from the age of four and his achievements have already received extensive media coverage in his home country.</p>
<p>He has also gained knowledge of C++, the programming language developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup, without any formal training.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kid seems pretty exceptional. Welcome, Wasik! I don’t expect the programs to be very complicated, and I’ll leave aside questions of balancing computer time with real-world time and exercise, but this is still quite an achievement.</p>
<p>How young were you when you wrote your first program? I discovered computers for the first time at age 11 when I switched to a new school that had a PET 2001, and wrote my first BASIC programs when was 11 or 12, first on paper and then a little on the PET when I could get access to it. I still fondly remember when I finally got my own Atari 800 when I was 13… thanks again for the loan for that, mum and dad! the first loan I ever took, and paid off in a year with paper-route money. Having that computer was definitely worth a year of predawn paper delivery in the rain, sleet, and snow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just posted the following panel announcement to the <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com">C++ and Beyond site</a>. The three-day event (plus evening-before reception) with me, Scott Meyers, and Andrei Alexandrescu will be held on August 5-8, and <a href="http://cppandbeyond2012.eventbrite.com/">early-bird registration is open until May 31</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<hr /><a href="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/image_thumb12.png"><img title="image_thumb[1]" style="border-top:0;border-right:0;background-image:none;border-bottom:0;float:right;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;margin:10px 0 10px 10px;border-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;" border="0" alt="image_thumb[1]" align="right" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/image_thumb1_thumb.png?w=324&#038;h=184" width="324" height="184" /></a>C++11 is kind of like “C++ Dreamliner.” It’s built with world-class modern materials. It took a couple more years to finish than originally expected. But now it’s starting to roll out worldwide and flying <a href="http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/boeing-787-dreamliner-smashes-distance-and-sets-speed-records-284704">more safely and efficiently than ever</a>. (European readers may equally consider it <a href="http://www.airbus.com/aircraftfamilies/passengeraircraft/a380family/a380-800/">“C++ 380.”</a>)  </p>
<p>As I write and teach about C++11, I emphasize that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern C++ is <strong>clean, safe, and fast</strong> – modern C++ code is as readable and as type- and memory-safe as code written in any other modern language <strong>[*]</strong>, and it has always been the king of ‘fast’ and is now faster than ever with new features like move semantics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bjarne Stroustrup</strong> made me add, at the end of the “clean and safe” part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“[*] When used in a modern style.” – Bjarne Stroustrup</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bjarne and I claim this to be true. Others have disputed various parts of this statement – whether C++11 really has a usable safe subset, whether C++ is really necessarily faster than code in other languages, and other questions. What’s the truth?</p>
<p>These answers matter. Type safety and memory safety are important not only for writing reliable code that will fail or be abused less often, but also for improving developer productivity so that developers can spend less time on overhead “taxes” like checking for unsafe casts or buffer overruns. And the claim that C++ really is the king of “fast” has been consistently challenged for most of its history.</p>
<p>In this panel, Scott, Andrei, and I will weigh in with discussion – and data – on these important and current questions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Braun asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>@Tom @Herb: What’s so wrong with flash that it should be boycotted? Have I been being abused by it in some way I’m not aware of? Also,does HTML5 have any bearing on the subject?</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not saying it should be boycotted, only that I avoid it. Here&#8217;s what I wrote two years ago: <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2010/03/30/flash-in-the-pan/">“Flash In the Pan”</a>.  Besides security issues and crashing a lot, Flash is a headache for servicing and seems to be architecturally unsuited for lower-power environments.</p>
<p>Since then, two more major developments:</p>
<h3>1. Even Adobe has given ground (if not given up).</h3>
<p>Adobe subsequently <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/flash-focus.html">abandoned Flash for mobile browsers</a> and started shipping <a href="http://html.adobe.com/">straight-to-HTML5 tools</a>.</p>
<p>Granted, Adobe says it’s abandoning Flash ‘only for new mobile device browsers while still supporting it for PC browsers.’ This is still a painful statement because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s obvious that ceding such <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/networking/flash-is-dead-long-live-html5/1633">high-profile</a> and <a href="http://www.imore.com/2010/04/29/adobe-ceo-responds-steve-jobs-open-letter/">hard-fought</a> ground sends a message about overall direction; and</li>
<li>the distinction between mobile devices and PCs is quickly disappearing as of this year as PCs are becoming fully mobilized (more on this in my next blog post).</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. We’re moving toward plugin-avoiding browsing.</h3>
<p>Browsers are increasingly moving to reduce plugins, or eliminate them outright, for security/reliability/servicing reasons. Moving in that direction crease pressure or necessity to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>ban Flash (Mobile Safari, and <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20105870-264/microsoft-joins-the-anti-flash-crowd-with-ie10/">Metro style Internet Explorer 10</a>); or</li>
<li>deliver Flash built into the browser itself (even for plugin-allowing browsers <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=108086">like Chrome</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not saying Flash will die off immediately or necessarily even die off entirely at all; there’s a lot of inertia, it’s still useful in many kinds of devices, and it may well hang on for some time. But its architectural problems and current trajectory are fairly clear, and it’s been months since I’ve heard someone complain that certain people were just <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">being unfair</a> – Jobs’ technical points are on the right side of history.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month in Kansas City I gave a talk on &#8220;Welcome to the Jungle,&#8221; based on <a href="https://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle/">my recent essay of the same name</a> (sequel to &#8220;The Free Lunch Is Over&#8221;) concerning the turn to mainstream heterogeneous distributed computing and the end of Moore’s Law.</p>
<p>Perceptive Software has now made the talk available online <em>[<strong>EOA</strong>: the talk itself starts six minutes in]</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><a href="http://shadow-technologies.tv/video/179">Welcome to the Jungle</a></strong></p>
<p>In the twilight of Moore’s Law, the transitions to multicore processors, GPU computing, and HaaS cloud computing are not separate trends, but aspects of a single trend – mainstream computers from desktops to ‘smartphones’ are being permanently transformed into heterogeneous supercomputer clusters. Henceforth, a single compute-intensive application will need to harness different kinds of cores, in immense numbers, to get its job done. – The free lunch is over. Now welcome to the hardware jungle.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>Warning: It&#8217;s two hours (with Q&amp;A) because of the broad and deep material. There&#8217;s a nice pause point between major sections at the one-hour mark that makes it convenient to split it into two one-hour lunchtime brownbag viewings.</p>

Here’s one about us: The difference between the best worker on computer hardware and the average may be 2 to 1, if you&#8217;re lucky. With automobiles, maybe 2 to 1.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, Brent Schlender published <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/165/steve-jobs-highlights">selected Steve Jobs quote highlights</a> from his interview tape archives.</p>
<p>Here’s one about us:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>The difference between the best worker on computer hardware and the average may be 2 to 1, if you&#8217;re lucky. With automobiles, maybe 2 to 1. But in software, it&#8217;s at least 25 to 1. The difference between the average programmer and a great one is at least that.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>This illustrates that there’s always lots of headroom to keep growing as a developer. We should always keep learning, and strive to become ever stronger at our craft.</p>
<p>You might also enjoy the history and observant commentary in Schlender’s other new article <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/165/steve-jobs-legacy-tapes">The Lost Steve Jobs Tapes</a>, which focuses on “the wilderness years.”</p>

Both are now online at Channel 9.</p>
<p>Here’s the 40-min C++ talk, taken from the C9 site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2012/-Not-Your-Father-s-C-">(Not Your Father’s) C++</a>        <br />Herb Sutter&#160; <br /></strong></p>
<p>What makes ISO C++11 &quot;feel like a new language&quot;? What things that we know about past C++ do we need to unlearn? Why is C++ designed the way it is – historically, and in C++11? Finally, what is the difference between managed and native languages anyway, and when is each applicable? This talk gives an overview and motivation of modern C++ and why it&#8217;s clean, safe, and fast – as clean to code in and as type-safe as any modern language, and more than ever the king of &quot;fast.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the panel (my favorite highlight is at <strong>24:00-28:00</strong>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2012/Panel-Native-Languages">Lang.NEXT 2012 Expert Panel: Native Languages</a>        <br />Walter Bright, Robert Griesemer, Andrei Alexandrescu, Herb Sutter</strong></p>
<p>Native programming languages panel hosted by Martyn Lovell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope you enjoy them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to post a link to Vincent Lextrait&#8217;s nice (and actively maintained) catalog of what languages are used to build what modern and major mainstream software:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.lextrait.com/vincent/implementations.html"><strong>The Programming Languages Beacon</strong></a></p>
<p>This table contains a list of major software products or utilities, with details about the programming languages used to implement them. Information on this is difficult to find, and a few small mistakes might have escaped the <a href="mailto:vincent@lextrait.com">author</a>&#8216;s attention. Corrections, suggestions for additions or even references are welcome. &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>A nice data point to use to show that the world is built on C++ (and its C subset).</p>
<p>The table was compiled without bias on the part of the person who compiled it; he&#8217;s just trying to gather information. If you think a language is under-represented, send mail to Vincent with specific project data (make sure it&#8217;s something you know of first-hand or can point to an authoritative source) and I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll be glad to add it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With so much happening in the computing world, now seemed like the right time to write <a href="https://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle/"><strong>“Welcome to the Jungle”</strong></a><strong> </strong>– a sequel to my earlier “The Free Lunch Is Over” essay. Here’s the introduction:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong><a href="https://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle/">Welcome to the Jungle</a></strong></h3>
<p align="center"><em>In the twilight of Moore’s Law, the transitions to multicore processors, GPU computing, and HaaS cloud computing are not separate trends, but aspects of a single trend – mainstream computers from desktops to ‘smartphones’ are being permanently transformed into heterogeneous supercomputer clusters. Henceforth, a single compute-intensive application will need to harness different kinds of cores, in immense numbers, to get its job done.</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>The free lunch is over. Now welcome to the hardware jungle.</em></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>From 1975 to 2005, our industry accomplished a phenomenal mission: In 30 years, we put a personal computer on every desk, in every home, and in every pocket.</p>
<p>In 2005, however, mainstream computing hit a wall. In <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm"><strong>“The Free Lunch Is Over”</strong> (December 2004)</a>, I described the reasons for the then-upcoming industry transition from single-core to multi-core CPUs in mainstream machines, why it would require changes throughout the software stack from operating systems to languages to tools, and why it would permanently affect the way we as software developers have to write our code if we want our applications to continue exploiting Moore’s transistor dividend.</p>
<p>In 2005, our industry undertook a new mission: to put a personal parallel supercomputer on every desk, in every home, and in every pocket. 2011 was special: it’s the year that we completed the transition to parallel computing in all mainstream form factors, with the arrival of multicore tablets (e.g., iPad 2, Playbook, Kindle Fire, Nook Tablet) and smartphones (e.g., Galaxy S II, Droid X2, iPhone 4S). 2012 will see us continue to build out multicore with mainstream quad- and eight-core tablets (as Windows 8 brings a modern tablet experience to x86 as well as ARM), <a href="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/image_thumb99.png"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:right;padding-top:0;border-width:0;margin:20px 0 0 10px;" title="image_thumb99" border="0" alt="image_thumb99" align="right" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/image_thumb99_thumb.png?w=480&#038;h=228" width="480" height="228" /></a>and the last single-core gaming console holdout will go multicore (as Nintendo’s Wii U replaces Wii).</p>
<p>This time it took us just six years to deliver mainstream parallel computing in all popular form factors. And we know the transition to multicore is permanent, because multicore delivers compute performance that single-core cannot and there will always be mainstream applications that run better on a multi-core machine. There’s no going back.</p>
<p>For the first time in the history of computing, mainstream hardware is no longer a single-processor von Neumann machine, and never will be again.</p>
<p><em>That was the first act.&#160; . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>As I’m getting ready to resume writing a few new (or updated) Guru of the Week Items for the C++11 era, I’ve been looking through the wonderful features of C++11 and analyzing just which ones will affect the baseline style of how I write modern C++ code, both for myself and for publication.</p>
<p>I’ve gathered the results in a short page. Here’s the intro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://herbsutter.com/elements-of-modern-c-style/">Elements of Modern C++ Style</a></strong></p>
<p align="center"><em>“C++11 feels like a new language.” – Bjarne Stroustrup</em></p>
<p>The C++11 standard offers many useful new features. This page focuses specifically and only on those features that make C++11 really feel like a new language compared to C++98, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>They change the styles and idioms you’ll use when writing C++ code, often including the way you’ll design C++ libraries. For example, you’ll see more smart pointers, and functions that return big objects by value. </li>
<li>They will be used so pervasively that you’ll probably see them in most code examples. For example, virtually every five-line modern C++ code example will say “auto” somewhere. </li>
</ul>
<p>Use the other great C++11 features too. But get used to these ones first, because these are the pervasive ones that show why C++11 code is clean, safe, and fast – just as clean and safe as code written in any other modern mainstream language, and with C++’s traditional to-the-metal performance as strong as ever.</p>
<p>Like Strunk &amp; White, this page is deliberately focused on brief summary guidance. It is not intended to provide exhaustive rationale and pro/con analysis; that will go into other articles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope you find it useful.</p>
<p>Apologies in advance if some of the code snippets are odd or missing template argument lists. Let me know and I’ll fix any I missed. I think I restored them all (again), but am still fighting my tools, which keep sporadically eating angle-bracket lists. Someday someone will integrate good code authoring in a good editor for a good blogging platform; today’s tools are at best “adequate.”</p>

<p>In response to my <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2011/10/25/john-mccarthy/">note about John McCarthy’s inventing automatic (non ref-counted) garbage collection</a>, rosen4obg asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>OK, GC was invented half a century ago. When it is going to land in the C++ world?</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s a short but detailed answer, which links to illuminating reading and videos.</p>
<h3>The Three Kinds of GC</h3>
<p>The three major families of garbage collection are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reference counting.</li>
<li>Mark-sweep (aka non-moving) collectors, where objects are collected but live objects don&#8217;t move. This is what McCarthy first invented.</li>
<li>Mark-compact (aka moving) collectors, where live objects are moved together to make allocated memory more compact. Note that doing this involves updating pointers&#8217; values on the fly. This category includes semispace collectors as well as the more efficient modern ones like the .NET CLR&#8217;s that don&#8217;t use up half your memory or address space.</li>
</ol>
<p>When I say &#8220;automatic GC&#8221; I mean #2 or #3.</p>
<h3>GC and C++</h3>
<p>C++ has always supported #1 well via reference counted smart pointers. Those are now standard in C++11 in the form of unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr. C++98 had auto_ptr, but it was never great and has been deprecated.</p>
<p>C++ has long supported #2, but less formally because the products were nonstandard, conservative, and not as portable. The major prior art is the Boehm (later Great Circle and Symantec) mark-sweep garbage collector. The new C++11 standard has just added a minimal GC ABI to more formally bless such non-moving collectors; see <a href="http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/C++0xFAQ.html#gc-abi">Stroustrup&#8217;s GC FAQ</a> for more.</p>
<p>C++ cannot support #3 without at least a new pointer type, because C/C++ pointer values are required to be stable (not change their values), so that you can cast them to an int and back, or write them to a file and back; this is why we created the ^ pointer type for C++/CLI which can safely point into #3-style compacting GC heaps. See section 3.3 of my paper <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/C++CLIRationale.pdf">A Design Rationale for C++/CLI</a> for more rationale about ^ and gcnew.</p>
<h3>Other GC Resources</h3>
<p>For a wonderful 57-minute conversation on garbage collection by one of the world&#8217;s top GC experts, run don&#8217;t walk to the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/E2E-Erik-Meijer-and-Patrick-Dussud-Inside-Garbage-Collection">C9 “Inside Garbage Collection” interview with Patrick Dussud</a>. Patrick wrote the .NET CLR&#8217;s GC, and it was far from his first; before that he had deep experience implementing Lisp runtimes, and I&#8217;m sure has forgotten more about GC than I&#8217;ll ever know. He&#8217;s also a great guy to work with.</p>
<p>For a great book on GC, I love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Garbage-Collection-Algorithms-Automatic-Management/dp/0471941484"><em>Garbage Collection</em> by Jones and Lins</a>.</p>

<p>What a sad, horrible month. First <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2011/10/06/steve-jobs/">Steve Jobs</a>, then <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2011/10/12/dennis-ritchie/">Dennis Ritchie</a>, and now John McCarthy. We are losing many of the greats all at once.</p>
<p>If you haven’t heard of John McCarthy, you’re probably learning about his many important contributions now. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>He’s the inventor of Lisp, the second-oldest high-level programming language, younger than Fortran by just one year. Lisp is one of the most influential programming languages in history. Granted, however, most programmers don’t use directly Lisp-based languages, so its great influence has been mostly indirect.</li>
<li>He coined the term “artificial intelligence.” Granted, however, AI has got a bad rap from being oversold by enthusiasts like Minsky; for the past 20 years or so it’s been safer to talk in euphemisms like “expert systems.” So here too McCarthy’s great influence has been less direct.</li>
<li>He developed the idea of time-sharing, the first step toward multitasking. Okay, now we’re talking about a contribution that’s pretty directly influential to our modern systems and lives.</li>
</ul>
<p>But perhaps McCarthy’s most important single contribution to modern computer science is still something else, yet another major technology you won’t hear nearly enough about as being his invention:</p>
<p><strong>Automatic garbage collection. </strong>Which he invented circa 1959.</p>
<p>No, really, that’s not a typo: <strong>1959.</strong> For context, that year’s first quarter alone saw the beginning of the space age as Sputnik 1 came down at the end of its three-month orbit; Fidel Castro take Cuba; Walt Disney release <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Music_Died">The Day the Music Died</a>; the first Barbie doll; and President Eisenhower signing a bill to enable Hawaii to become a state.</p>
<p>GC is <em>ancient</em>. Electronic computers with core memory were still something of a novelty (RAM didn’t show up until a decade or so later), machine memory was measured in scant kilobytes, and McCarthy was already managing those tiny memories with automatic garbage collection.</p>
<p>I’ve encountered people who think GC was invented by Java in 1995. It was actually invented more than half a century ago, when our industry barely even existed.</p>
<p>Thanks, John.</p>
<p>And here’s hoping we can take a break for a while from writing these memorials to our giants.</p>

<p>As a tribute in honor of <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2011/10/12/dennis-ritchie/">Dennis Ritchie’s passing</a>, I’d like to invite you to share your thoughts in this post’s comments about your first C program – either the code if you remember it approximately, or a story about when you wrote it.</p>
<p>Here’s mine.</p>
<p>I wrote my first C program in 1988 as a lab assignment for a fourth-year course in computer graphics at the University of Waterloo. In the first day or two of the course, our prof gave us our first assignment: Write a program that displays and controls a 3D animated robot with moving head, arms, and legs. Successive assignments would let us swoop around him, controlling point of view and zoom with a mouse, and other nifty features, but the first assignment was just to get him on-screen and capable of a little basic motion.</p>
<p>Oh, and the program was to be written:</p>
<ul>
<li>to run on one of the lab’s four brand-new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGI_IRIS">SGI IRIS</a> workstations (oh, here’s the manual);</li>
<li>using a custom UofW internal library (oh, here’s the manual);</li>
<li>in C (we assume you know it, use man to learn this compiler’s command line switches if you need to);</li>
</ul>
<p>and it’s due in a few days. I can’t remember exactly now, but I think we had something like five days. After all, this was just a warm-up initial exercise for the course.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: I had never used C. Never even seen it.</p>
<p>Oh, I’d used many different languages in my undergrad career, from Cobol to Pascal to Prolog to 6809 assembler and many points between, but just never C. Don’t get the wrong impression, C <em>was</em> already used widely at UofW at the time and most of the other undergrads in the class knew it, but by some freak of course selection combined with professor allocation I somehow had managed to come across pretty much everything <em>but </em>C so far for the first three years.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131101633/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_2">K&amp;R</a>.</p>
<p>Armed with K&amp;R and a printed-out C tutorial, I had a few days to learn a new language <em>(huh? whaddayamean #include? oh, okay&#8230;)</em>, an unfamiliar compiler, an unfamiliar graphics library, and the quirks of this particular flavor of Unix – to produce a working program in an unfamiliar domain with unfamiliar concepts (graphics). And only that last bit was the actual topic material for the course. The language, compiler, library, etc. was just uninteresting scaffolding you were expected to know or just pick up on the fly, don’t bother the professor with questions about those when you can look it all up yourself.</p>
<p>I don’t remember what mark I got on the assignment, but the code worked.</p>
<p>I was glad that C was easy to learn, and that its manual in the form of K&amp;R was so clear to read and understand. Thanks again, Dennis.</p>

<p>My two talks from last week&#8217;s <a href="http://buildwindows.com">//build/</a> conference are online.</p>
<p>My personal favorite is <strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/TOOL-835T">Writing Modern C++ Code: How C++ Has Evolved Over the Years</a></strong>. The thesis is simple: Modern ISO Standard C++ code is clean, safe, and fast. C++ has got a bad rap over the years, partly earned, but that&#8217;s history. This talk is a &#8220;welcome to modern C++&#8221; for programmers who may never have seen C++ before, or are familiar only with older and more difficult C++.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re already a modern C++ developer you may be thinking, &#8220;but I do most of those things already, why is there a whole talk on this at a Microsoft conference?&#8221; Because as interest and use of Standard C++ is heating up again, it&#8217;s important to ensure that people have a good experience as they return to C++, or turn to it for the first time. Thus we sometimes have called this the &#8220;happy path&#8221; talk &#8212; designed to show the simple happy path through modern C++ that avoids needless pitfalls.</p>
<p>My other talk was <strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/TOOL-532T">Using the Windows Runtime From C++</a></strong>. This is Windows 8-specific and talks about the &#8220;foreign object model&#8221; language extensions used by Visual C++ 11 to talk to the new native ABI-safe WinRT types. These extensions should be used sparingly, only on the thin module boundaries around otherwise nice and portable Standard C++ code, and it was necessary to add them only because Standard C++ types aren&#8217;t ABI-safe and accessible safely from other languages. (If ISO C++ were to get a module system at some point that includes being able to talk about ABI-safe types on module boundaries, that would be happiness indeed!) There is also a template library called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh309536%28VS.85%29.aspx">Windows Runtime C++ Template Library (WRL)</a> that is another way to access basically the same functionality using template syntax; pick whichever you like best.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who attended!</p>

<p>Channel 9 has just posted a recording of my intro talk at <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com">C++ and Beyond 2011</a> last month in Banff. Here&#8217;s the link: <strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/C-and-Beyond-2011-Herb-Sutter-Why-C" target="_blank">C++ and Beyond 2011: Why C++</a>.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a keynote-y talk, not a technical talk, but we felt it was important to address an important trend involving the language. The goal is to share a perspective and rationale for why of late there&#8217;s such a resurgence of interest in C++ &#8212; both across the industry, and within Microsoft.</p>
<p>Whether or not you agree with the perspective and rationale, I hope you enjoy it!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just posted two more sessions I&#8217;ll be giving next month at <em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com">C++ and Beyond</a></em>. (Aside: If you&#8217;re interested in coming, <a href="http://cppandbeyond2011.eventbrite.com/">register</a> soon; there are now only 11 seats left.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/07/08/session-announcement-c-renaissance/">&#8220;C++ Renaissance.&#8221;</a></em></strong> I’ve been asked to give the opening “Welcome, Everyone!” keynote talk at C&amp;B 2011, and it’s time to cover an increasingly open secret: After a decade-long affair with managed languages where it became unfashionable to be interested in C++, C++’s power and efficiency are now getting very fashionable again. At the same time, C++ has been getting easier to use; key productivity features from the C++0x standard (aka C++11), like auto and lambdas, are increasingly widely available in commercial compilers and making using C++ easier than ever before without sacrificing its cornerstone — efficiency.This opening 40-minute talk covers the reasons why C++ is now enjoying a major <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=C%2B%2B+renaissance">renaissance</a>, and why that will continue to grow over the next few years because of industry trends from processor design to mobile computing to cloud and datacenter environments.We already know that C++ is “the” language of choice for demanding applications. Here, we’ll cover why “demanding applications” increasingly means “most applications” and will be the bread and butter of our industry for the foreseeable future. We’ll see why and where other languages are still appropriate, but why C++’s applicability and demand is now again on an upswing more so than it has been for over a decade.</li>
<li><strong><em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/07/08/session-announcement-how-to-teach-todays-c/">&#8220;How to Teach Today&#8217;s C++.&#8221;</a></em></strong>  With the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=C%2B%2B+renaissance">C++ Renaissance</a> gathering steam, I’ve personally noticed a growing need to train developers who are now turning or returning to C++. These developers don’t need to be taught how to program, but they aren’t familiar with how clean it is to write code using today’s C++. The key is: What is the best and clearest way to teach the essentials of today’s C++ — both what to teach, and what not to teach?This session shows that it is possible to show a very clean path through today’s C++ that is available to production developers right now, including use of key C++0x features already supported in many compilers, that shows how clean C++ code can be and how it compares favorably to code written in managed languages while still retaining its longstanding efficiency advantage.Many attendees coming to <em>C++ and Beyond</em> are experienced developers, often in senior or leadership positions. Your company may look to you to define or personally provide training in the best development techniques, whether through team brownbags or formal training sessions. As developers continue to come back to C++, you will find yourself increasingly called upon to help them quickly learn what “modern C++” really means today, and how clear and compelling it can be. This “train the trainers” session is intended to provide the foundation for that training, and give you the tools you need to train others, as we welcome them (and welcome them back) to our good friend C++.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve already posted these other sessions, which round out my solo talk slots (not counting panels where Scott and Andrei and I will also all participate):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/02/session-announcement-c-and-the-gpu-and-beyond/">“C++ and the GPU… and Beyond.”</a></em></strong> I’ll cover the state of the art for using C++ (not just C) for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPGPU">general-purpose computation on graphics processing units (GPGPU)</a>. The first half of the talk discusses the most important issues and techniques to consider when using GPUs for high-performance computation, especially where we have to change our traditional advice for doing the same computation on the CPU. The second half focuses on upcoming C++ language and library extensions that bring key abstractions for GPGPU — and in time considerably more — directly into C++.</li>
<li> <em><strong><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/12/session-announcement-exceptional-c0x-aka-c11/">“Exceptional C++0x (aka C++11)”</a></strong></em> that shows how the new features in C++0x change the way we solve problems, our C++ coding style, and even the way we think about our code. I’ll demonstrate that with code that works today on existing compilers, using selected familiar examples from my <em>Exceptional C++ </em>books. This is not rehashed material, as I’ll assume you’re already familiar with the pre-C++0x solutions (I’ll provide links to read as refreshers before the course), and then we’ll analyze and solve them entirely the 21st-century C++ way and see why C++0x feels like a whole new fresh language that leads to different approaches, new and changed guidelines, and even better solutions. As Bjarne <a href="http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/C++0xFAQ.html">put it</a>: “Surprisingly, C++0x feels like a new language: The pieces just fit together better than they used to and I find a higher-level style of programming more natural than before and as efficient as ever.” This talk will show why — deeply, madly, and truly.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I had the privilege of talking about some of the work we&#8217;ve been doing to support massive parallelism on GPUs in the next version of Visual C++. The video of my talk announcing C++ AMP <strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/AFDS-Keynote-Herb-Sutter-Heterogeneous-Computing-and-C-AMP">is now available on Channel 9</a></strong>. (Update: Here&#8217;s an <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/AMD-Fusion-Developer-Summit/AMD-Fusion-Developer-Summit-11/KEYNOTE">alternate link</a>; it seems to be posted twice.)</p>
<p>The first 20 minutes has nothing to do with C++ in particular or any platform in particular, but tries to make the case that the right way to view the &#8220;trends&#8221; of multicore computing, GPU computing, and cloud computing (HaaS) is that they are not three trends at all, but merely facets of the same single trend &#8212; heterogeneous parallel computing.</p>
<p>If they are, then one programming model should be able to address them all. We think we&#8217;ve found one.</p>
<p>The main reasons we decided to build a new model is that we believe there needs to be a single model that has all of the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>C++, not C:</strong> It should leverage C++&#8217;s power for strong abstraction without sacrificing performance, not just be a dialect of C.</li>
<li><strong>Mainstream:</strong> It should be programmable by millions of developers, not just by a priesthood. Litmus test: Is the Hello World parallel GPU program a page and half, or a couple of lines?</li>
<li><strong>Minimal:</strong> It adds just one general-purpose language extension that addresses not only the immediate problem (dealing with cores that can&#8217;t support full C++) but many others. With the right general-purpose extension, the rest can be done as just a library.</li>
<li><strong>Portable:</strong> It allows shipping a single EXE that can use any combination of GPU vendors&#8217; hardware. The initial implementation uses DirectCompute and supports all devices that are DX11 capable; DirectCompute is just an implementation detail of the first release, and the model can (and I expect will) be implemented to directly talk to any interesting hardware.</li>
<li><strong>General and future-proof:</strong> The initial release will focus on GPU computing, but it&#8217;s intended to enable people to write code for the GPU in a way that in the future we can recompile with few or no changes to spread across any and all accessible compute cores, including ones in the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Open:</strong> I mentioned that Microsoft intends to make the C++ AMP specification open, and encourages its implementation on other C++ compilers for any hardware or OS target. AMD announced that they will implement C++ AMP in their FSA reference compiler. NVidia also announced support.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;re really excited about this, and I hope you find the information in the talk to be useful. A prerelease implementation in Visual C++ that runs on Windows will be available later this year. More to come&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Channel 9 just posted a new <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Conversation-with-Herb-Sutter-Perspectives-on-Modern-C0x11">interview with me</a> about ISO C++0x, C++&#8217;s place in the modern world, and all things C++. The topics we talked about ranged pretty widely, as you can see from the questions below.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the blurb as posted on Channel 9 with links to specific questions in the interview. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Herb</p>
<blockquote><p>I was lucky enough to catch up with <a href="https://herbsutter.com/" target="_blank">Herb Sutter</a> not too long after the <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2011/03/25/we-have-fdis-trip-report-march-2011-c-standards-meeting/" target="_blank">FDIS announcement</a> (Final Draft International Standard is complete).</p>
<p>As usual when talking to Herb, the conversation is all about C++ (well, we <em>do</em> talk about C# for a little while, but in the context of C++. Why? Tune in&#8230;).</p>
<p>See below for the specific questions that were asked. You can simply click on a link to move directly to that point in the conversation. I do, however, strongly recommend that <em>you watch the entire thing</em>. I also recommend that you don&#8217;t get used to this level of categorization in my videos (it takes a fair amount of time to do this sort of thing, so enjoy the times when I actually do this, but don&#8217;t expect me to do this all of the time).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always great to talk to Herb and get a glimpse of what goes on in the C++ Standards Committee (which Herb chairs). In this specific conversation, it&#8217;s uplifting to see how excited Herb is for the future of one of the world&#8217;s most capable and widely used general purpose programming languages. C++ is a modern programming language for power and performance, but it&#8217;s also a highly abstracted general purpose language for building user mode applications, mobile apps, etc. The amazing part is how C++ can provide rich general programming abstractions and also ensure that your code can run at machine speeds. We talk about this, of course.</p>
<p>Tune in. Learn. Go native!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scott Meyers, Andrei Alexandrescu and I are continuing to craft and announce the technical program for <strong><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/">C++ and Beyond (C&amp;B) 2011</a></strong>, and two more sessions are now posted. All talks are brand-new material created specifically for C&amp;B 2011. Here are short blurbs; follow the links for longer descriptions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scott will give a great new talk on <em><strong><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/11/session-announcement-the-c0x-memory-model-and-why-you-care/">&#8220;The C++0x Memory Model and Why You Care&#8221;</a></strong></em> that will cover topics of interest to anybody who cares about concurrency and parallel programming under C++0x: everything from compiler optimizations and memory access reorderings, to “sequenced before” and “happens before” relations, to atomic types and memory consistency models, and how they all relate to both correctness and performance. This is stuff that in a perfect world nobody should ever have to know, but in our actual world every modern C++ developer who cares about correct high-performance code has to understand it thoroughly.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll be giving a brand-new talk  <em><strong><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/12/session-announcement-exceptional-c0x-aka-c11/">&#8220;Exceptional C++0x (aka C++11)&#8221;</a></strong></em> that shows how the new features in C++0x change the way we solve problems, our C++ coding style, and even the way we think about our code. I&#8217;ll demonstrate that with code that works today on existing compilers, using selected familiar examples from my <em>Exceptional C++</em> books. This is not rehashed material, as I&#8217;ll assume you&#8217;re already familiar with the pre-C++0x solutions (I&#8217;ll provide links to read as refreshers before the course), and then we&#8217;ll analyze and solve them entirely the 21st-century C++ way and see why C++0x feels like a whole new fresh language that leads to different approaches, new and changed guidelines, and even better solutions. As Bjarne <a href="http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/C++0xFAQ.html">put it</a>: &#8220;Surprisingly, C++0x feels like a new language: The pieces just fit together better than they used to and I find a higher-level style of programming more natural than before and as efficient as ever.&#8221; This talk will show why &#8212; deeply, madly, and truly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other two talks already announced are the following, which I <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2011/04/05/c-and-beyond-2011/">previously reported last week</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrei will be giving an in-depth talk on <strong><em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/03/31/session-announcement-big/">“BIG: C++ Strategies, Data Structures, and Algorithms Aimed at Scalability.”</a></em></strong> Briefly, it’s about writing high-performance C++ code for  highly distributed architectures, focusing on translating C++’s strong modeling capabilities directly to great scaling and/or great savings, and finding the right but non-intuitive C++ techniques and data structures to get there.</li>
<li>I’ll be giving a brand-new talk on <strong><em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/02/session-announcement-c-and-the-gpu-and-beyond/">“C++ and the GPU… and Beyond.”</a></em></strong> I’ll cover the state of the art for using C++ (not just C) for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPGPU">general-purpose computation on graphics processing units (GPGPU)</a>. The first half of the talk discusses the most important issues and techniques to consider when using GPUs for high-performance computation, especially where we have to change our traditional advice for doing the same computation on the CPU. The second half focuses on upcoming C++ language and library extensions that bring key abstractions for GPGPU — and in time considerably more — directly into C++.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope to see many of you there this August. Last year&#8217;s event sold out during the early-bird period, and although we&#8217;ve increased the attendance cap this year to make room for more, if you&#8217;re interested in coming you may want to <a href="http://cppandbeyond2011.eventbrite.com/">register</a> soon to reserve a place.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a couple of months, I&#8217;ll be giving a keynote at the <a href="http://developer.amd.com/afds/">AMD Fusion Developer&#8217;s Summit</a>, which will be held on June 13-16, 2011, in Bellevue, WA, USA.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my talk&#8217;s description as it <a href="http://developer.amd.com/afds/pages/keynote.aspx">appears</a> on the conference website:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><a href="http://developer.amd.com/afds/pages/keynote.aspx">AFDS Keynote: “Heterogeneous Parallelism at Microsoft”</a></strong><br />
<em>Herb Sutter, Microsoft Principal Architect, Native Languages</em></p>
<p>Parallelism is not just in full bloom, but increasingly in full variety. We know that getting full computational performance out of most machines—nearly all desktops and laptops, most game consoles, and the newest smartphones—already means harnessing local parallel hardware, mainly in the form of multicore CPU processing. This is the commoditization of the supercomputer.</p>
<p>More and more, however, getting that full performance can also mean using gradually ever-more-heterogeneous processing, from local GPGPU and Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) flavors to “often-on” remote parallel computing power in the form of elastic compute clouds. This is the generalization of the heterogeneous cluster in all its NUMA glory, and it’s appearing at all scales from on-die to on-machine to on-cloud.</p>
<p>In this talk, Microsoft’s chief native languages architect shares a vision of what this will mean for native software on Microsoft platforms from servers to devices, and showcases upcoming innovations that bring access to increasingly heterogeneous compute resources — from vector units and multicore, to GPGPU and APU, to elastic cloud — directly into the world’s most popular native languages.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in high performance code for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPGPU">GPUs</a>, <a href="http://sites.amd.com/us/fusion/apu/Pages/fusion.aspx">APUs</a>, and other high-performance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym">TLAs</a>, I hope to see you there.</p>
<p>Note: This talk is related to, but different from, the <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/02/session-announcement-c-and-the-gpu-and-beyond/">GPU talk I&#8217;ll be presenting</a> in August at <em><a href="https://herbsutter.com/2011/04/05/c-and-beyond-2011/">C++ and Beyond 2011</a></em> (aka C&amp;B). You can expect the above keynote to be, well, keynote-y&#8230; oriented toward software product features and of course AMD&#8217;s hardware, with plenty of forward-looking industry vision style material. My <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/02/session-announcement-c-and-the-gpu-and-beyond/">August C&amp;B technical talk</a> will be just that, an in-depth performance-oriented and sometimes-gritty technical session that will also mention product-related and hardware-specific stuff but is primarily about heterogeneous hardware, with a more pragmatically focused forward-looking eye.</p>

All of my own talks will be brand-new material never given publicly before.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s program will be heavily oriented toward performance (first) and C++0x (second). There are two talks announced so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrei will be giving an in-depth talk on <strong><em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/03/31/session-announcement-big/">&#8220;BIG: C++ Strategies, Data Structures, and Algorithms Aimed at Scalability.&#8221;</a></em></strong> Briefly, it&#8217;s about writing high-performance C++ code for  highly distributed architectures, focusing on translating C++&#8217;s strong modeling capabilities directly to great scaling and/or great savings, and finding the right but non-intuitive C++ techniques and data structures to get there.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll be giving a brand-new talk on <strong><em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/02/session-announcement-c-and-the-gpu-and-beyond/">&#8220;C++ and the GPU&#8230; and Beyond.&#8221;</a></em></strong> I&#8217;ll cover the state of the art for using C++ (not just C) for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPGPU">general-purpose computation on graphics processing units (GPGPU)</a>. The first half of the talk discusses the most important issues and techniques to consider when using GPUs for high-performance computation, especially where we have to change our traditional advice for doing the same computation on the CPU. The second half focuses on upcoming C++ language and library extensions that bring key abstractions for GPGPU — and in time considerably more — directly into C++.</li>

<p>An announcement for a third (also performance-focused) talk should be posted within the week, with more to come as we continue to announce the talk schedule as it firms up.</p>
<p><a href="http://cppandbeyond2011.eventbrite.com/">Registration is now open.</a> I hope many of you will be able to make it.</p>

<p>At <em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com">C++ and Beyond</a></em> next week (and in December) I&#8217;ll also be giving a brand-new half-day talk on <em>Elements of Design</em>.</p>
<p>I’m passionate about design, in part because it requires specific skills and taste, but most off all because it’s so important for every programmer — whether building a new library or extending one, building a new class or maintaining one, and that covers pretty much all of us.</p>
<p>In recent years, I’ve been spending a lot of my time leading design work in diverse areas ranging from general- and special-purpose library design, to systems software architecture, to programming language design and evolution, including participating in the crafting of various C++0x language and library features.</p>
<p>Although those areas are pretty diverse, they also have a lot of commonalities, and the insights and learnings apply directly to mainstream classes-and-libraries production software design. I’ve organized the topics to cover proven design practices at three levels:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Design process:</em> Running a design effort to set it up for repeatable success. This isn&#8217;t about heavyweight Process with a capital P, it&#8217;s about practices that  apply universally to projects of any size &#8212; when the projects are smaller, the elements can be informal.</li>
<li><em>Design principles:</em> Fundamental truths that guide design choices toward high quality.</li>
<li><em>Design elements:</em> Key specific design points and best practices to learn and apply.</li>
</ol>
<p>We&#8217;ll build these areas from the bottom up &#8212; first key elements as the foundation, then the principles that unify the elements, and finally the process that enables staying true to the principles. Each process, principle, and practice is illustrated using real-world examples drawn from personal experience in many different design areas, but always targets “how you can use this today”: concrete skills and techniques for the development of well-designed production software and applications.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward very much to this topic in particular, not only in this talk itself but also in the informal and unstructured fireside time built into the <em>C++ and Beyond</em> schedule. Together with my other new talk on <em><a href="https://herbsutter.com/2010/10/07/c-and-beyond-session-lambdas-lambdas-everywhere/">Lambdas, Lambdas Everywhere</a></em>, my part of <em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com">C++ and Beyond</a></em> will be 100% new material never seen in public before &#8212; 270 minutes&#8217; worth (whew). I look forward to seeing many of you there next week, or at the December &#8220;Encore&#8221; event where <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2010/10/07/c-and-beyond-encore-public-registration-now-open/">registration opened</a> two weeks ago.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll be posting abstracts (summaries) of the <em>C++ and Beyond 2010</em> sessions over the coming days over at the C&amp;B <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com">site</a>. Below is the first, for my talk on <strong><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2010/10/07/session-details-lambdas-lambdas-everywhere/">&#8220;Lambdas, Lambdas Everywhere.&#8221;</a></strong></p>
<p>This is a brand new talk. I delivered a &#8216;sneak peek&#8217; preview of a subset of this material in conjunction with the ISO C++ standards meeting in Switzerland two months ago, but the full talk will be given publicly for the first time at <em>C++ and Beyond</em>.</p>
<p>Historical trivia: This talk exists because Bjarne Stroustrup asked for it. Bjarne knew that I felt lambda functions were a game-changing feature that would have a pervasive impact on C++ coding style across many domains, and he asked me to write up the examples demonstrating why. This talk is the result.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why care about C++0x lambda functions? Syntactically, they are nothing but sugar for function objects. However, they are an essential and enabling sugar that will change the way we will write C++ code more often than most people realize.</p>
<p>This talk will cover what lambda functions are and how to use them effectively, including how lambdas touch many wide-ranging kinds of code — from their convenience when writing concurrent and scalably parallel code, to how they stand to revolutionize STL usability and programming, to how they enable such small conveniences as local functions and local variable initialization.</p>
<p>Note that lambda functions, although futuristic, are not a far-future feature. They are available today in several shipping C++ compilers, including Intel C++ 11, Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, and gcc 4.5. The future is now. Come find out how this powerful feature affects you and your code.</p>
<p><em>About the speaker:</em> Herb Sutter is an architect on the Windows C++ team at Microsoft and the chair of the ISO C++ standards committee. He is the main designer of lambda functions in Visual C++ 2010 and their integration with the VC++ Parallel Patterns Library, and is partly responsible for the design of lambda functions in the C++0x standard, notably their final syntax.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month&#8217;s <em>Effective Concurrency</em> column, <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/go-parallel/article/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=227500074">&#8220;Know When to Use an Active Object Instead of a Mutex,&#8221;</a> is now live on DDJ&#8217;s website.
</p>
<p>From the article:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that your program has a shared log file object. The log file is likely to be a popular object; lots of different threads must be able to write to the file; and to avoid corruption, we need to ensure that only one thread may be writing to the file at any given time.</p>
<p>Quick: How would you serialize access to the log file?</p>
<p>Before reading on, please think about the question and pencil in some pseudocode to vet your design. More importantly, especially if you think this is an easy question with an easy answer, try to think of at least two completely different ways to satisfy the problem requirements, and jot down a bullet list of the advantages and disadvantages they trade off.</p>
<p>Ready? Then let&#8217;s begin.

<p>Of course, that’s because the page/site is the real app. And like most apps they are indeed going the other way.</p>
<p>The browser is not really an app; it’s a shell, like the OS shell, just a runtime necessity to run the real app and provide some convenience housekeeping tools. Shells generally try to remove clutter (though admittedly this goes in waves) because they know they’re not the main attraction.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month&#8217;s <em>Effective Concurrency</em> column, <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/go-parallel/article/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=226700179">&#8220;Prefer Using Futures or Callbacks to Communicate Asynchronous Results,&#8221;</a> is now live on DDJ&#8217;s website.
</p>
<p>From the article:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This time, we&#8217;ll answer the following questions: How should we express return values and out parameters from an asynchronous function, including an active object method? How should we give back multiple partial results, such as partial computations or even just &#8220;percent done&#8221; progress information? Which mechanisms are suited to callers that want to &#8220;pull&#8221; results, as opposed to having the callee &#8220;push&#8221; the results back proactively? And how can &#8220;pull&#8221; be converted to &#8220;push&#8221; when we need it? Let&#8217;s dig in…

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month’s <strong>Effective Concurrency</strong> column, “<a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/go-parallel/article/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=JM3XD1KM22SCRQE1GHPSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=225700095">Prefer Using Active Objects Instead of Naked Threads</a>,” is now live on DDJ’s website.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… Active objects dramatically improve our ability to reason about our thread&#8217;s code and operation by giving us higher-level abstractions and idioms that raise the semantic level of our program and let us express our intent more directly. As with all good patterns, we also get better vocabulary to talk about our design. Note that active objects aren&#8217;t a novelty: UML and various libraries have provided support for active classes. Some actor-based languages already have variations of this pattern baked into the language itself; but fortunately, we aren&#8217;t limited to using only such languages to get the benefits of active objects. </p>
<p>This article will show how to implement the pattern, including a reusable helper to automate the common parts, in any of the popular mainstream languages and threading environments, including C++, C#/.NET, Java, and C/Pthreads.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I forgot to blog about this until now because of focusing on the Effective Concurrency course in Stockholm a few weeks ago, but to answer those who wonder if I’ll be giving it again in North America too: Yes, I’m also giving the public <a href="http://www.construx.com/Page.aspx?nid=17&amp;id=108"><strong>Effective Concurrency course</strong></a> again at the end of this month at the Construx facility in Bellevue, WA, USA. This will be the full four-day version of the course. Spaces are still available.</p>
<p>I’ll cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fundamentals: </strong>Define basic concurrency goals and requirements • Understand applications’ scalability needs • Key concurrency patterns</li>
<li><strong>Isolation — Keep work separate: </strong>Running tasks in isolation and communicate via async messages • Integrating multiple messaging systems, including GUIs and sockets • Building responsive applications using background workers • Threads vs. thread pools</li>
<li><strong>Scalability — Re-enable the Free Lunch:</strong> When and how to use more cores • Exploiting parallelism in algorithms • Exploiting parallelism in data structures • Breaking the scalability barrier</li>
<li><strong>Consistency — Don’t Corrupt Shared State:</strong> The many pitfalls of locks–deadlock, convoys, etc. • Locking best practices • Reducing the need for locking shared data • Safe lock-free coding patterns • Avoiding the pitfalls of general lock-free coding • Races and race-related effects</li>
<li><strong>High Performance Concurrency:</strong> Machine architecture and concurrency • Costs of fundamental operations, including locks, context switches, and system calls • Memory and cache effects • Data structures that support and undermine concurrency • Enabling linear and superlinear scaling</li>
<li><strong>Migrating Existing Code Bases to Use Concurrency </strong></li>
<li><strong>Near-Future Tools and Features </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope to see some of you there!</p>
<p><strong>Update 8/19:</strong> I had planned to do the EC course again in October (hence the post title) but that now has to be deferred to sometime in the new year. Sorry for any inconvenience to those of you who had already registered, or were planning to. I&#8217;ll blog about it here when it&#8217;s rescheduled.</p>
