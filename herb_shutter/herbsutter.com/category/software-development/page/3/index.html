They made a nice recording and it’s now available online here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facebook Engineering</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151029515183109"><strong>Title: Herb Sutter: Welcome to the Jungle</strong></a></p>
<p>In the twilight of Moore&#8217;s Law, the transitions to multicore processors, GPU computing, and HaaS cloud computing are not separate trends, but aspects of a single trend—mainstream computers from desktops to &#8216;smartphones&#8217; are being permanently transformed into heterogeneous supercomputer clusters. Henceforth, a single compute-intensive application will need to harness different kinds of cores, in immense numbers, to get its job done. &#8212; The free lunch is over. Now welcome to the hardware jungle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/attachment/Welcome_to_the_Jungle_-_FB-pdf/">slides are available here</a>. (There doesn’t seem to be a link to the slides on the page itself as I write this.)</p>
<p>For those interested in a longer version, in April I gave a 105-minute + Q&amp;A version of this talk in Kansas City at Perceptive, also <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/04/23/talk-video-welcome-to-the-jungle/">available online where I posted before</a>.</p>
<h3>A word about “cluster in a box”</h3>
<p>I should have remembered that describing a PC as a “heterogeneous cluster in a box” is a big red button for people, in particular because “cluster” implies “parts can fail and program should continue.” So in the Q&amp;A, one commenter made the point that I should have mentioned reliability is an issue.</p>
<p>As I answered there, I half agree – it’s true but it’s only half the story, and it doesn’t affect the programming model (see more below). One of the slides I omitted to shorten this version of the talk highlighted that there are actually two issues when you go from “Disjoint (tightly coupled)” to “Disjoint (loosely coupled)”: <strong>reliability</strong> <em>and </em><strong>latency</strong>, and both are important. (I also mentioned this in the <a href="https://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle/">original WttJ article</a> this is based on; just search for “reliability.”)</p>
<p>Even after the talk, I still got strong resistance along the lines that, ‘no, you obviously don’t get it, latency isn’t a significant issue at all, reliability is the central issue and it kills your argument because it makes the model fundamentally different.’ Paraphrasing subsequent email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘A fundamental difference between distributed computing and single-box multiprocessing is that in the former case you don&#8217;t know whether a failure was a communication failure (i.e. the task was completed but communication failed) or a genuine failure to carry the task. (Hence all complicated two-phase commit protocols etc.) In contrast, in a single-box scenario you can know the box you&#8217;re on is working.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me respond further to this here, because clearly these guys know more about distributed systems than I do and I’m always happy to be educated, but I also think we have a disconnect on three things asserted above: It is not my understanding that reliability is more important than latency, or that apps have to distinguish comms failures from app exceptions, or that N-phase commit enters the picture.</p>
<p>First, I don’t agree with the assertion that reliability alone is what’s important, or that it’s more important than latency, for the following reason:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You can build reliable transports on top of unreliable ones.</strong> You do it through techniques like sequencing, redundancy, and retry. A classic example is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>, which delivers reliable communications over notoriously- and deliberately-unreliable IP which can drop and reorder packets as network nodes and communications paths keep madly appearing and reappearing like a herd of crazed Cheshire cats. We can and do build secure reliable global banking systems on that.</li>
<li><strong>Once you do that, you have turned a reliability issue into a performance (specifically latency) issue.</strong> Both reliability and latency are key issues when moving to loosely-coupled systems, but because you can turn the first into the second, it’s latency that is actually the more fundamental and important one – and the only one the developer needs to deal with.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to use compute clouds like Azure and AWS, you usually start with two basic pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>the queue(s), which you use to push the work items out/around and results back/around; and </li>
<li>an elastic set of compute nodes, each of which pulls work items from the queue and processes them.</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens when you encounter a reliability problem? A node can pull a work item but fail to complete it, for example if the node crashes or the system encounters a partial network outage or other communication problem.</p>
<p>Many modern systems already automatically recover and have another node re-pull the same work item to make sure each work item gets done even in the face of partial failures. From the app&#8217;s point of view, such <strong>failures just manifest as degraded performance (higher latency or time-to-solution) and therefore mainly affect the granularity of parallel work items</strong> – they have to be big enough to be worth sending elsewhere and so minimum size is directly proportional to latency so that the overheads do not dominate. They do not manifest as app-visible failures.</p>
<p>Yes, the elastic cloud implementation has to deal with things like network failures and retries. But no, this isn’t your problem; it’s not supposed to be your job to implement the elastic cloud, it’s supposed to be your job just to implement each node’s local logic and to create whatever queues you want and push your work item data into them.</p>
<p>Aside: Of course, as with any retry-based model, you have to make sure that a partly-executed work item doesn’t expose any partial side effects it shouldn’t, and normally you prevent that by doing the work in a transaction and rolling it back on failure, or in the extreme (not generally recommended but sometimes okay) resorting to compensating writes to back out partial work. </p>
<p>That covers everything except the comment about two-phase commit: Citing that struck me as odd because I haven’t heard much us of that kind of coupled approach in years. Perhaps I’m misinformed, but my impression of 2- or N-phase commit protocols was that they have some serious problems: </p>
<ul>
<li>They are inherently nonscalable. </li>
<li>They increase rather than decrease interdependencies in the system – even with heroic efforts like majority voting and such schemes that try to allow for subsets of nodes being unavailable, which always seemed fragile to me. </li>
<li>Also, I seem to remember that NPC is a blocking protocol, which if so is inherently anti-concurrency. One of the big realizations in modern mainstream concurrency in the past few years is that Blocking Is Nearly Always Evil. (I’m looking at you, <em>future.get()</em>, and this is why the committee is now considering adding the nonblocking <em>future.then()</em> as well.)</li>
</ul>
<p>So my impression is that these were primarily of historical interest – if they are still current in modern datacenters, I would appreciate learning more about it and seeing if I’m overly jaded about N-phase commit.</p>

					<p>I’ve been <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/GoingNative-2012/C-11-VC-11-and-Beyond">beating the drum this year</a> (see the last section of the talk) that the biggest problem facing C++ today is the lack of a large set of <em>de jure</em> and <em>de facto</em> standard libraries. My team at Microsoft just recently announced <strong><a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/04/30/c-libraries-casablanca/">Casablanca</a></strong>, a cloud-oriented C++ library and that we intend to open source, and we’re making other even bigger efforts that I hope will bear fruit and I’ll be able to share soon. But it can’t be just one company – many companies have already shared great open libraries on the past, but still more of us have to step up.</p>
<p>In that vein, I was extremely happy to see another effort come to fruition today. A few hours ago I was at Facebook to speak at their C++ day, and I got to be in the room when Andrei Alexandrescu dropped his arm to officially launch <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/folly-the-facebook-open-source-library/10150864656793920">Folly</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><font size="3"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/folly-the-facebook-open-source-library/10150864656793920">Folly: The Facebook Open Source Library</a></font></h4>
<p>by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/delong.j">Jordan DeLong</a> on Saturday, June 2, 2012 at 2:59pm ·</p>
<p>Facebook is built on open source from top to bottom, and could not exist without it. As engineers here, we use, contribute to, and release a lot of open source software, including pieces of our core infrastructure such as <a href="https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php">HipHop</a> and <a href="http://thrift.apache.org/">Thrift</a>.</p>
<p>But in our C++ services code, one clear bottleneck to releasing more work has been that any open sourced project needed to break dependencies on unreleased internal library code. To help solve that problem, today we open sourced an initial release of Folly, a collection of reusable C++ library artifacts developed and used at Facebook. This announcement was made at our C++ conference at Facebook in Menlo Park, CA.</p>
<p>Our primary aim with this &#8216;foolishness&#8217; is to create a solution that allows us to continue open sourcing parts of our stack without resorting to reinventing some of our internal wheels. And because Folly&#8217;s components typically perform significantly faster than counterparts available elsewhere, are easy to use, and complement existing libraries, we think C++ developers might find parts of this library interesting in their own right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrei announced that Folly stood for the <strong><font color="#0000ff">F</font></strong>acebook <strong><font color="#0000ff">O</font></strong>pen <strong><font color="#0000ff">Ll</font></strong>ibrar<strong><font color="#0000ff">y</font></strong>. He claimed it was a Welsh name, which is even funnier when said by a charming Romanian man.</p>
<p>Microsoft, and I personally, would like to congratulate Facebook on this release! Getting more high-quality open C++ libraries is a Good Thing, and I think it is safe to say that Casablanca and Folly are just the beginning. There’s a lot more coming&#160; across our industry this year. Stay tuned.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>It’s time for, not one, but two brand-new, up-to-date talks on the state of the art of concurrency and parallelism in C++. I’m going to put them together <strong>especially and only for <em><a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/">C++ and Beyond 2012</a></em></strong>, and I’ll be giving them nowhere else this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><font size="3">C++ Concurrency – 2012 State of the Art (and Standard)</font></strong> </li>
<li><strong><font size="3">C++ Parallelism – 2012 State of the Art (and Standard)</font></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>And there’s a lot to tell. 2012 has already been a busy year for the pushing the boundaries of both “shipping-and-practical” and “proto-standard” concurrency and parallelism in C++:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In February</strong>, the <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/03/08/trip-report-february-2012-c-standards-meeting/">spring ISO C++ standards meeting</a> saw record attendance at 73 experts (normal is 50-55), and spent the full week primarily on new language and library proposals, with notable emphasis on the area of concurrency and parallelism. There was so much interest that I formed four Study Groups and appointed chairs: the largest on concurrency and parallelism (SG1, Hans Boehm), and three others on modules (SG2, Doug Gregor), filesystem (SG3, Beman Dawes), and networking (SG4, Kyle Kloepper). </li>
<li><strong>Three weeks ago</strong>, we hosted another three-day face-to-face meeting for SG1 and SG4 – and at nearly 40 people the SG1 attendance rivaled that of a normal full ISO C++ meeting, with a who’s-who of the world’s concurrency and parallelism experts in attendance and <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/04/06/we-want-await-a-c-talk-thats-applicable-to-c/">further proposal presentations</a> from companies like IBM, Intel, and Microsoft. There was so much interest that I had to form a new Study Group 5 for Transactional Memory (SG5), and appointed Michael Wong of IBM as chair. </li>
<li>Over the summer, we’ll all be working on updated proposals for the October ISO C++ meeting in Portland. </li>
</ul>
<p>Things are heating up, and we’re narrowing down which areas to focus on.</p>
<p>I’ve spoken and written on these topics before. Here’s what’s different about these talks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand new: </strong>This material goes beyond what I’ve written and taught about before in my <em>Effective Concurrency</em> articles and courses. </li>
<li><strong>Cutting-edge current:</strong> It covers the best-practices state of the art <strong>techniques</strong> and <strong>shipping tools</strong>, and what parts of that are standardized <strong>in C++11 already</strong> (the answer to that one may surprise you!) and what’s en route to <strong>near-term standardization</strong> and why, with coverage of the latest discussions. </li>
<li><strong>Mainstream hardware – many kinds of parallelism:</strong> What’s the relationship among <strong>multi-core</strong> CPUs, <strong>hardware threads</strong>, SIMD <strong>vector units</strong> (Intel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions">SSE</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">AVX</a>, ARM <a href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/neon.php">Neon</a>), and <strong>GPGPU </strong>(general-purpose computation on GPUs, which I covered at <em>C++ and Beyond 2011</em>)? Which are most interesting, what technologies are available now, and what’s being considered for near-term standardization? </li>
<li><strong>Blocking vs. non-blocking:</strong> What’s the difference between blocking and non-blocking styles, why on earth would you care, which kinds does C++11 support, and how are we looking at rounding it out in C++1<em>y</em>? </li>
<li><strong>Task and data parallelism:</strong> What’s the difference between task parallelism and data parallelism, which kind of of hardware does each allow you to exploit, and why? </li>
<li><strong>Work stealing: </strong>What’s the difference between thread pools and work stealing, what are the major flavors of work stealing, which of these (if any) does C++11 already support and is already shipping on some advanced commercial C++ compilers today (this answer will likely surprise you), and what needs to be done in the next round for a complete state-of-the-art parallelism story in C++1<em>y</em>? </li>
</ul>
<p>The answers all matter to you – even the ones not yet in the C++ standard – because they are real, available in shipping products, and affect how you design your software today.</p>
<p>This will be a broad and deep dive. At C++ and Beyond 2011, the <em>attendees</em> (audience!) included some of the world’s leading experts on parallelism and compilers. At these sessions of C&amp;B 2012, I expect anyone who wasn’t personally at the SG1 meeting this month, even world-class experts, will learn something new in these talks. I certainly did, and that’s why I’m motivated to turn the information into talks and share. This isn’t just cool stuff – it’s important and useful in production code today.</p>
<p>I hope to see many of you at C&amp;B 2012. I’m excited about these topics, and about Scott’s and Andrei’s new material – you just can’t get this stuff anywhere else.</p>
<p>Asheville is going to be blast. I can’t wait.</p>
<p>Herb</p>
<hr />
<p>P.S.: I haven’t seen this much attention and investment in C++ since last century – C++ conferences at record numbers, C++ compiler investments by the biggest companies in the industry (e.g., Clang), and much more that we’ve seen already…</p>
<p>… and a little bird tells me there’s a lot more major C++ news coming this year. Stay tuned, and fasten your seat belts. 2012 ain’t done yet, not by a long shot, and I’ll be able to say more about C++ as a whole (besides the specific topics mentioned above) for the first time at C&amp;B in August. I hope to see you there.</p>
<p>FYI, C&amp;B is already over 60% full, and early bird registration ends this Friday, June 1 – so <a href="http://cppandbeyond2012.eventbrite.com/">register today</a>.</p>

					<p>Want to know how to write cool tablet apps using Visual C++?</p>
<p>On May 18, Microsoft is hosting a <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Announcing-Building-Windows-8-Metro-Style-Apps-with-C-A-Free-Event">one-day free technical event for developers who want to write Metro apps for Windows 8 using Visual C++</a>. I’m giving the opening talk, and the rest of the day is full of useful technical information on everything from XAML and DirectX to networking and VC++ compiler flags.</p>
<p>Please note: This event is Windows-specific, and talks will use both portable ISO C++ as well as Visual C++-specific libraries and compiler extensions; for brevity these are being referred to as &quot;C++&quot; to highlight to a Microsoft-specific audience that that this day is about Visual C++, not about Visual C# or Visual Basic or JavaScript.</p>
<p>From the page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Join the Microsoft Visual C++ and Windows teams in Redmond on May 18, 2012 for a free, all-day event focused on building Windows 8 Metro style apps with C++.&#160; </p>
<p>These Windows-specific talks will use both portable ISO C++ and Visual C++-specific compiler extensions; for brevity below we&#8217;ll refer to both as &quot;C++&quot; (i.e., this day is about Visual C++, not Visual C# or JavaScript).</p>
<p>We will have pragmatic advice for every developer writing Metro style apps and games with XAML and/or DirectX and C++.</p>
<p><a href="https://win8.msregistration.com/default.aspx?ID=559a9ac4-96a6-46a1-b359-598e345d25be"><strong>Register now!</strong></a></p>
<p>Agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual C++ for Windows 8, Keynote by Herb Sutter</li>
<li>Building Windows 8 apps with XAML and C++</li>
<li>Building Windows 8 games with DirectX and C++</li>
<li>Introduction to the Windows Runtime Library&#160; (WRL)</li>
<li>Writing Connected apps: Writing networking code with C++</li>
<li>Combining XAML &amp; DirectX in a Metro style apps</li>
<li>Writing WinRT components to be consumed from any language</li>
<li>VC11 compiler flags for getting the most out of C++</li>
</ul>
<p>All sessions will be recorded and available for on demand viewing on C9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wish I’d blogged about it right away when it was announced a week or so ago, because registration filled immediately before I could blog it (I think on the first day), and then when the room was expanded it filled again right away again before I could blog about it. Then I procrastinated for a few days. You can still <a href="https://win8.msregistration.com/default.aspx?ID=559a9ac4-96a6-46a1-b359-598e345d25be">register here for the waitlist</a> to see it in person, but I have good news…</p>
<p><strong>All sessions will be broadcast livestream and then available for viewing on demand.</strong> If you’re halfway around the world, or just halfway across the country, it’s hard to fly somewhere for a one-day event anyway; thanks to livestream and on-demand, the Internet is our friend. I look forward to seeing and e-seeing many of you there.</p>

The goal is to find or develop modern C++ libraries that leverage C++11 features, and then submit the best for standardization.</p>
<p>Microsoft wants to do its part, and here’s a step in that direction.</p>
<p>Today I’m pleased to see Soma’s post about <strong><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2012/04/30/devlabs-c-cloud-services-and-you.aspx">“C++, Cloud Services, and You”</a></strong> announcing the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/casablanca"><strong>DevLabs release of Casablanca</strong></a>, a set of C++ libraries for Visual C++ users that start to bring the same modern conveniences already enjoyed by .NET and Node.js and Erlang users also to C++ developers on our local and cloud platforms, including modern C++ libraries for REST, HTTP, and JSON. From Soma’s announcement, adding my own <strong>emphasis </strong>and minor code edits:</p>
<blockquote><p>Historically, we’ve lacked such simple tools for developers using C++.  While there are multiple relevant native networking APIs (e.g. WinINet, WinHTTP, IXMLHttpRequest2, HTTP Server API), these are not optimized from a productivity perspective for <strong>consuming and implementing RESTful cloud services using modern C++</strong>.  They don’t compose particularly well with code based on the standard C++ libraries, and they don’t <strong>take advantage of modern C++ language features and practices</strong> in their programming models.</p>
<p>This is where “Casablanca” comes in.  “Casablanca” is a set of libraries for C++ developers, taking advantage of some recent standard language features already available through Visual Studio.</p>
<p><strong>“Casablanca” aims to make it significantly easier for C++ coders to consume and implement RESTful services.  It builds on lessons from .NET, from Node.js, from Erlang, and from other influencers to create a modern model that is meant to be easy to program while still being scalable, composable, and flexible.</strong></p>
<p>As an example, here’s a snippet that uses the client HTTP library to search Bing for my name and output the results to the console:</p>
<pre>    http_client bing( L"http://www.bing.com/search" );

    bing.request( methods::GET, L"?q=S.Somasegar" )
        .then( []( http_response response ) {
            cout &lt;&lt; "HTML SOURCE:" &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; response.to_string() &lt;&lt; endl; })
        .wait();</pre>
<p>and here’s a simple web listener hosted in a console application:</p>
<pre>    listener::create( argv[1], []( http_request req ) {
            req.reply( status_codes::OK, "Namaste!" ); })
        .listen( []{ fgetc( stdin ); } )
        .wait();</pre>
<p>For those of you looking to build Azure services in C++, “Casablanca” comes with a Visual Studio wizard to set up everything up correctly.  You can target both Web and Worker roles, and you can access Azure storage using the built-in C++ library bindings. […] Taking C++ to the cloud with “Casablanca” is another exciting step in that journey.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today’s Casablanca release is as a DevLabs project, to get usability feedback and to eventually support these features in the full Visual C++ product. If you’re interested in using C++ to consume and implement cloud services, and sharing what kind of support you want and whether you think Casablanca is on the right track, please let us know in the <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/casablanca/threads">forums</a>.</p>
<p>Looking beyond Visual C++, one piece of Casablanca is already being proposed for standardization, namely the “future.then” nonblocking continuations that are required to be able to write highly responsive composable libraries – you really want all async libraries to talk about their work using the same type, and std::future already gives half of what we need (blocking synchronization) and just needs the non-blocking part too. Also being proposed as an optional layer on top of “future.then” is an “await” style of language support to make the async operations as easy to express and use in C++ as in any of the best languages in the world.</p>
<p>Note that there are other C++ libraries too for several of these facilities. Repeating what I said at GoingNative, we (Microsoft) don’t care whose libraries get standardized – whether ones we contribute or someone else’s. We care most that <em>there be</em> standard C++ libraries for these modern uses, starting with the most basic “future.then” support, and to encourage all companies and groups who have libraries in these important spaces to contribute them and take the best and make them available to C++ developers on all platforms. This is a small step in that process.</p>

					<p>I’m seeing many younger programmers picking up C++. The average age at C++ events over the past year has been declining rapidly as the audience sizes grow with more and younger people in addition to the C++ veterans.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://www.computeach.co.uk/IT-news/IT-Computer-Technology-News/IT-industry-news-Six-year-old-computer-whiz-aims-for-record/801352474">this one just beats all</a> [Facebook link added]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A six-year-old child from Bangladesh is hoping to be officially recognised as the world&#8217;s youngest computer programmer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Wasik-Farhan-Roopkotha/100000454476401">Wasik Farhan-Roopkotha</a> showed an aptitude for computing at an early age and started typing in Microsoft Word at just three years old, BBC News reports.</p>
<p>The precocious youngster was programming game emulators from the age of four and his achievements have already received extensive media coverage in his home country.</p>
<p>He has also gained knowledge of C++, the programming language developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup, without any formal training.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kid seems pretty exceptional. Welcome, Wasik! I don’t expect the programs to be very complicated, and I’ll leave aside questions of balancing computer time with real-world time and exercise, but this is still quite an achievement.</p>
<p>How young were you when you wrote your first program? I discovered computers for the first time at age 11 when I switched to a new school that had a PET 2001, and wrote my first BASIC programs when was 11 or 12, first on paper and then a little on the PET when I could get access to it. I still fondly remember when I finally got my own Atari 800 when I was 13… thanks again for the loan for that, mum and dad! the first loan I ever took, and paid off in a year with paper-route money. Having that computer was definitely worth a year of predawn paper delivery in the rain, sleet, and snow.</p>

<hr /><a href="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/image_thumb12.png"><img title="image_thumb[1]" style="border-top:0;border-right:0;background-image:none;border-bottom:0;float:right;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;margin:10px 0 10px 10px;border-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;" border="0" alt="image_thumb[1]" align="right" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/image_thumb1_thumb.png?w=324&#038;h=184" width="324" height="184" /></a>C++11 is kind of like “C++ Dreamliner.” It’s built with world-class modern materials. It took a couple more years to finish than originally expected. But now it’s starting to roll out worldwide and flying <a href="http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/life/boeing-787-dreamliner-smashes-distance-and-sets-speed-records-284704">more safely and efficiently than ever</a>. (European readers may equally consider it <a href="http://www.airbus.com/aircraftfamilies/passengeraircraft/a380family/a380-800/">“C++ 380.”</a>)  </p>
<p>As I write and teach about C++11, I emphasize that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern C++ is <strong>clean, safe, and fast</strong> – modern C++ code is as readable and as type- and memory-safe as code written in any other modern language <strong>[*]</strong>, and it has always been the king of ‘fast’ and is now faster than ever with new features like move semantics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bjarne Stroustrup</strong> made me add, at the end of the “clean and safe” part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“[*] When used in a modern style.” – Bjarne Stroustrup</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bjarne and I claim this to be true. Others have disputed various parts of this statement – whether C++11 really has a usable safe subset, whether C++ is really necessarily faster than code in other languages, and other questions. What’s the truth?</p>
<p>These answers matter. Type safety and memory safety are important not only for writing reliable code that will fail or be abused less often, but also for improving developer productivity so that developers can spend less time on overhead “taxes” like checking for unsafe casts or buffer overruns. And the claim that C++ really is the king of “fast” has been consistently challenged for most of its history.</p>
<p>In this panel, Scott, Andrei, and I will weigh in with discussion – and data – on these important and current questions.</p>
