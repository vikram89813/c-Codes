				<div class="entry">
					<p><em>[edited 2009.01.15 to add link to DDJ&#8217;s announcement]</em></p>
<p>2008 was quite a year, full of landmark events that were certainly historic, if not always welcome.</p>
<p>If I had to pick one technology-related highlight from the past year, it would be this: A notable inflection point in the ongoing shift from traditional media to the web. Given that that tide is still in progress, why single out 2008? <strong>I think we&#8217;ll look back at 2008, especially the fourth quarter, as a turning point when the web became an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-list">A-list</a> media outlet and first started to beat up, and even replace, major legacy competitors in newspapers, technical magazines, movies, and TV.</strong> An inflection point, if you will, where the web clearly stopped being the pencil-necked upstart, and visibly emerged as the new <a href="http://www.constitutionlive.com/wp-content/uploads/mostwanted_lou.jpg">gorilla</a> flexing its advertising-revenue-pumped-up muscles and kicking sand on the others.</p>
<p>In 2008, and particularly in the last month, the web began to outright replace some existing newspapers and technology and programming magazines.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>December 2008: The first two major city newspapers go web-only or web-mostly.</strong> <a href="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081216/METRO/812160419">The Detroit News</a> and <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20081216/FREEPRESS/81216032">The Detroit Free Press</a> announced truncated print editions and reduced print delivery. Newspapers in several other cities seem likely to follow fairly soon.</li>
<li><strong>As of January 2009: <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/">PC Magazine</a> is <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2335009,00.asp">going &#8220;digital only.&#8221;</a></strong> After the January issue, the print magazine will disappear. Instead, the content will appear exclusively on the web.</li>
<li><strong>As of January 2009: </strong><a href="http://www.ddj.com"><strong>Dr. Dobb&#8217;s Journal</strong></a><strong> is permanently suspending print publication and<a href="http://www.ddj.com/linux-open-source/212700891"> going web-only</a></strong><strong>.</strong> Some of the content will be available as a new &#8220;Dr. Dobb&#8217;s Report&#8221; section of <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/">InformationWeek</a>. My Effective Concurrency column will continue, and I&#8217;ll continue to blog when new columns go live on the web, so if you&#8217;re reading the column via this blog nothing will significantly change for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of next month, the only major technical programmer&#8217;s trade magazines still available in print, that I know of, are platform- and technology-specific ones like <a href="http://www.aspnetpro.com/">asp.netPRO</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/default.aspx">MSDN Magazine</a> &#8212; and even those increasingly feature online-only content. For example, from MSDN Mag&#8217;s <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2009.01.editorsnote.aspx">January 2009 editor&#8217;s note</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we continue to grow our coverage to keep pace with the rapidly expanding set of technologies, we will often offer content exclusively online at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine">msdn.microsoft.com/magazine</a>. So please check in frequently!</p></blockquote>
<p>Gotta love RSS (and Atom etc.): Every text feed is like a magazine or newspaper column, every blogger a columnist. Every audio/video podcast feed is like a radio or TV series, or a radio station or TV channel. And our feed reader is the new magazine/newspaper, as we subscribe to columnists to make our personal custom newsmagazine. But RSS readers, along with RSS-consuming clients like iTunes, are more &#8212; they&#8217;re our personal selection, not only of the columns we want to read (on whatever topics we want, including the funnies section), but also of the media we want to hear and watch. It&#8217;s increasingly our way to choose the text, audio, and video we want all together. Who knew that a large chunk of the coming media convergence would come in the shape of RSS readers?</p>
<p>And other media are feeling the pressure from Dr. Web, the new gorilla:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This week (late December 2008), even cable operator Time Warner pushed web delivery for TV.</strong> Time Warner has had various contract disputes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/business/media/31cable.html?ref=media">with Viacom</a> and <a href="http://www.caller.com/news/2008/dec/31/time-warner-kiii-reach-agreement/">some local stations</a>. But as part of the dispute:
<ul>Time Warner will respond to Viacom’s advertisement, [Time Warner spokesman] Mr. Dudley said, by highlighting the availability of television content on the Internet.</p>
<p>“We will be telling our customers exactly where they can go to see these programs online,” Mr. Dudley said. “We’ll also be telling them how they can hook up their PCs to a television set.”</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>During October-December 2008, Netflix&#8217;s Watch Instantly has started to turn into a juggernaut.</strong> It&#8217;s interesting enough that you can watch 12,000+ movies and TV shows streamed over the net to your PC at high quality. As of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/26/netflix-finally-brings-watch-instantly-to-macs-via-silverlight/">October 2008, you can get them on your Mac</a>. As of <a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/press/archive/2008/11/19/562420.aspx">November 2008, on your Xbox</a>. As of <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2008/12/tivo-dvrs-now-stream-movies-from.html">December 2008, on your TiVo</a>. As noted in one recent <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/12/24/BUR214QV6B.DTL">article</a>:
<ul>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good strategic move,&#8221; said Andy Hargreaves, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. &#8220;Netflix sees the world will go digital, no matter what they do. They realize there is more to be lost by waiting than doing it early.&#8221;</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And I won&#8217;t even get started on SaaS: hosted rich GUI apps served up on the web, for example the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSTRE4B75MP20081208">December 2008 (again) announcement about Office Online</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, don&#8217;t forget 2008, especially December 2008: The month the first major newspapers moved mostly to the web and abandoned print at least partly; the month that PC Magazine and Dr. Dobb&#8217;s suspended print publication and went web-only; the month Netflix Watch Instantly arrived in the living room on TiVos after hitting Xboxes a fortnight before; the month cable provider Time Warner threatened to tell people to watch TV on the net; and the month even Microsoft announced their intent to deliver significant Office web applications.</p>
<p>I for one welcome Dr. Web, our new Gorilla and media overlord!</p>
<p>Besides, what choice do I have?</p>

					<p>Even genuinely newsworthy topics can get distorted when commentators exaggerate or use data selectively. Here are two recent examples I noticed.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;This is the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.&#8221;</strong> It&#8217;s true that it&#8217;s bad and even historic, and this sound bite correctly doesn&#8217;t actually claim it&#8217;s as bad as the Depression. I hope it doesn&#8217;t turn out to be in the same league as that; then, people were lining up at soup kitchens. For now, however, Apple is still on track to sell 10 million iPhone 3Gs this year, which says something.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Yesterday [Monday, September 29, 2008] saw the worst single-day plunge in Dow Jones history.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s a new Black Monday.&#8221; </strong>Well, these got my attention, because I remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987)">Black Monday on October 19, 1987</a> very well. I was working in IT at a major bank, doing software application support for traders and related departments. When I went up to the trading floor that day, I immediately knew something was badly wrong because of the eerie sound as the elevator doors opened &#8212; a sound you never hear during trading hours, and certainly not from a room full of traders standing at their desks: silence.</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s loss of 777 points was stunning as the largest single-day point loss in Dow history. But as a <em>percentage</em> loss that&#8217;s not even in the top 10 Bad Dow Days, all but two of which occurred before 1935. Those two since the Depression occurred on October 19 and 26, 1987, when the Dow lost <strong>22.6%</strong> and then another <strong>8% </strong>of its total value in single sessions, respectively #2 and #9 on All-Time Bad Dow Days list. For perspective, as of this writing the Dow is down 19.8% so far this entire year, and it surely hasn&#8217;t been a good year. Today&#8217;s crisis is already historic and could well get worse yet, of course, but some of us do remember some pretty bad ones in the past.</p>
<p>As good old Sam Clemens said (approximately), there are lies, darned lies, and statistics. Even when the statistics are true, always cross-check them for perspective. Even the best news and the worst news can be overstated, and viewing the same data from multiple angles helps ensure we understand it properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Edited 9/30 to add: At 22.6%, Black Monday in 1987 was actually the worst Dow Day ever if you don&#8217;t count &#8220;reopening days&#8221; after unusual market closures when the markets catch up with events that happened while they were closed. So when was the all-time worst Dow Day ever? Perhaps surprisingly, the answer is not in 1929, though several of the all-time top 10 were in that year. Rather, it was December 12, 1914, when the Dow dropped 24.4% after the markets reopened after being closed entirely for over four months due to the outbreak of World War I. (The markets closed on July 30, two days after Austria-Hungary declared war and a day before Germany did.) That helps put in perspective just how bad October 1987 was, and of course that today&#8217;s crisis is also pretty bad even if it hasn&#8217;t beaten those prior records, yet.]</p>

					<p><a href="http://www.pcauthority.com.au/News/117291,computer-mouse-heading-for-extinction.aspx">This story</a> has been picked up semi-widely since last night. I&#8217;m sure this Steven Prentice they quote is a fine (Gartner) Fellow, but really:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The computer mouse is set to die out in the next five years and will be usurped by touch screens and facial recognition, analysts believe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seriously, does anyone who uses computers daily really believe this kind of prediction just because someone at Gartner says so? Dude, sanity check: 1. What functions do you use your mouse for? 2. How many of those functions can be done by pointing at your screen or smiling at the camera: a) at all; and b) with equivalent high precision and low arm fatigue? Of course the mouse, including direct equivalents like the touchpad/trackpad, will be replaced someday. But to notice that people like to turn and shake their Wii controllers and iPhones and then make the leap to conclude that this will replace mice outright in the short term seems pretty thin even for Gartner.</p>
<p>When you read a report from Gartner, Forrester, IDC and their brethren research firms, remember that you&#8217;re either getting real-world data (aka research) or a single analyst&#8217;s personal predictions (aka crystal-ball gazing). Research firms are good at what they&#8217;re good at, namely research:</p>
<ul>
<li>They&#8217;re &#8220;decent&#8221; at compiling current industry market data. Grade: A.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re &#8220;pretty okay&#8221; when they limit themselves to simple short-term extrapolation of that data, such as two-year projections of cost changes of high-speed networking in Canada or cell phone penetration in India. Grade: A-.</li>
</ul>
<p>But when they try bigger technology movement predictions like &#8220;X will replace Y in Z years&#8221; they average somewhere around &#8220;spotty,&#8221; and on their off days they dip down into &#8220;I think you forgot to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanity_test">sanity check</a> that sound bite&#8221; territory. It&#8217;s a pity that some venture capitalists take the research analysts&#8217; word as gospel. Reliability of technology shift predictions: D+.</p>

					<p>Two weeks ago, I broke down and bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle">Kindle</a>. I like it:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s a good and well-designed reader, and the experience is much better than the other e-book reading I&#8217;ve done before on phones and PDAs. I like how when you bookmark a page, you can see it&#8230; the corner of the page gets a little dog-ear. [1]</li>
<li>It&#8217;s got a nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper">e-paper</a> screen that uses ambient light, not backlight, which makes it readable anywhere just like a printed page &#8212; it&#8217;s even better, not worse, in direct sunlight.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s light and thin and sturdy. Sure beats carrying three or four books on a trip.</li>
<li>It has great battery life. I&#8217;ve only charged it once so far, when I first received it&#8230; since then I&#8217;ve had it for 11 days and read a full book and a half, and it still has 75% of its first charge left. (It helps that I turn the wireless off unless I&#8217;m actively using it.)</li>
<li>Fast, free wireless everywhere in the U.S., without computers or WiFi.</li>
</ul>
<p>But today, it transformed my reading experience.</p>
<p>This morning, I was unsuspectingly reading my feeds in Google Reader as usual, blissfully unaware that the way I read books was about to change. Among other articles, I noticed that Slashdot ran a <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/07/16/1330221">book review of <em>Inside Steve&#8217;s Brain</em></a> (that&#8217;s Jobs, not Wozniak or Ballmer). The review made me want to read the book. That&#8217;s when the new reality started, because I was interested in the book <em>now</em>, and had time to start reading it <em>now:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, I would have ordered it from Amazon and waited for it to arrive. But what usually happens then is that the book arrives a week later, and when it gets here I don&#8217;t have time to start it right away or I don&#8217;t quite feel like that kind of book just at the moment&#8230; and it goes on a shelf, with a 70% probability of being picked up at some point in the future.</li>
<li>Today, I searched for the book title on my Kindle, clicked &#8220;Buy&#8221;, and a few minutes later started reading <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Steves-Brain/dp/B0016H97LY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=digital-text&amp;qid=1216255732&amp;sr=1-1">Inside Steve&#8217;s Brain</a></em> while eating lunch. [2]</li>
</ul>
<p>That convenience isn&#8217;t merely instant gratification, it&#8217;s transformative. I suspect I&#8217;m going to be reading even more books now, even though I have a few little nits with the device, such as that the next and previous page buttons are a little too easy to press in some positions.</p>
<p>In other news, the Kindle also supports reading blogs and newspapers and some web surfing, but those are less compelling for me because I tend to do those things in the context of work, which means I&#8217;m already sitting at a computer with a bigger color screen and full keyboard. Maybe someday I&#8217;ll do it on e-paper. Until then, just living inside a virtual bookstore is plenty for me. Kindle + the Amazon Kindle store = iPod + iTunes for books. [3]</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/61186/2007/11/kindle.html">useful summary article</a> on Kindle features from a prospective user&#8217;s point of view.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>1. The first two books I downloaded? <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/0385267746">The Design of Everyday Things</a></em>, which was interestingly apropros to read on a new device like the Kindle with its nice dog-ear feedback and other well-designed features, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Foundation/dp/B000FC1PWA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=digital-text&amp;qid=1216255446&amp;sr=1-1"><em>Foundation</em></a>, which I hadn&#8217;t read in ages.</p>
<p>2. And it cost less than half what the dead-tree version would (though the latter was hardcover).</p>
<p>3. Caveat: I&#8217;m not actually an iPod owner, and I hate how Apple keeps insisting on installing iTunes on my computer just because I have Safari or QuickTime installed <span style="color:#808080;">(mutter grumble evil product-tying monopolies mutter grumble :-) )</span>. But apparently everyone else loves them, and they have indeed changed their industry.</p>

					<p>Breathless celebrity &quot;news&quot; reporting isn&#8217;t enough&#8230; apparently we also need a direct invitation to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_media">trial by media</a>. From <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">McNews</a>: </p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://byfiles.storage.msn.com/y1pmEhyM4hSkGi8FBSukSJwm8yNlhAtCDr_k4n4qs8lGjudSm6S7Fxq1SiQP5MhSq_0pSwixthPCDM"><img style="border-width:0;" height="176" alt="image" src="http://byfiles.storage.msn.com/y1pmEhyM4hSkGgMPUepxeijk1GCjKjQt8B_-V3iolKFAVFZLIwhW7DKnsGKIeP8narWHX-AqNKEWus" width="289" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>This is a perilous question in deceptively casual clothing. There should be nothing &quot;Quick&quot; about a question involving children&#8217;s lives. (Spears&#8217; name is immaterial &#8212; one could as well replace &quot;Britney Spears&quot; with &quot;Anyone&#8217;s Name,&quot; including yours or mine.) </p>
<p>It&#8217;s refreshing to see that McNews agrees we all have the right to enjoy a presumption of innocence. And that they would never encourage Joe Public to casually pass severe judgment on someone they don&#8217;t personally know, in absentia, based entirely on hearsay (especially hearsay reported by media with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias">selection bias</a> favoring sensational value), with a passing click of the mouse. </p>
<p>Removing children can be necessary, but it is a serious matter and so should be considered seriously through careful firsthand examination [*], not treated lightly as worthy of drive-by opinion-poll jurying. Perhaps I&#8217;m overly sensitive; I know of kids wrongly taken from their parents under outrageous pretexts, and the results can be tragic. </p>
<p>I understand the intent was just to throw out a quick question, and not to take it too seriously. That&#8217;s the problem. But then again, maybe making something profoundly important appear inconsequential is just playing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-side_and_B-side">B side</a> of celebrity &quot;news&quot; that tries to make the inconsequential appear profound. </p>
</p>
<p><strong>Footnotes</strong> </p>
<p>[*] Even with careful deliberation and due process, staggering mistakes can be and are made in serious matters. I&#8217;m currently reading John Grisham&#8217;s first nonfiction (and somewhat <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/polemic">polemic</a>) book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Innocent-Man-Murder-Injustice-Small/dp/0385517238"><em>The Innocent Man</em></a>, the tragic account of Ron Williamson, who was <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/burden/profiles/williamson.html">wrongly sentenced to death [PBS]</a> [**] for a murder he did not commit. According to Grisham&#8217;s account, Williamson was publicly hounded in a similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_media">trial by media</a> in the local newspaper that influenced community (and juror pool) opinion for years before he was ever charged with anything in that crime. Disclaimer: Of course, Grisham&#8217;s book too is a media voice, and his account of the case is itself <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116043445277887423.html?mod=2_1167_1">charged with one-sided reporting</a>. Nobody seems to dispute that the conviction was unjust, however, though people do disagree on where to lay blame. </p>
<p>[**] No, I&#8217;m not expressing an opinion on the death penalty.</p>

					<div>According to McNews (<a href="http://www.cnn.com">this one</a> and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com">that one</a>) this must be Entitlement Week&#8230; two examples (emphasis mine):</div>
<div> </div>
<ul>
<li>A week ago: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/06/08/paris.hilton.ap/index.html">&quot;&#8217;It&#8217;s <strong>not right</strong>!&#8217; shouted the weeping Hilton.&quot;</a>
</li>
<li>Today, re the Sopranos finale:[*] <a href="http://blogs.usatoday.com/oped/2007/06/shows_blank_scr.html">&quot;&#8217;To go out like that was <strong>not right</strong>,&#8217;&quot;</a> a reader complained.</li>
</ul>
<div>Wow; there must be something in the water. How did we teach people to feel they are owed so many things, from serious things like license to break the law without consequences, to trivial things like a right to have someone else&#8217;s creation suit their whims?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Maybe we need an unreality check.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>[*] I&#8217;ve never watched The Sopranos and don&#8217;t know anything about the show. I watch TV only occasionally, and when I do I generally prefer fare like <a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dogwhisperer/">Dog Whisperer</a> and an occasional <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/jeopardy/indexflash.php">Jeopardy</a>.</div>

					<p>Today, Slashdot is running an <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/03/07/2348254">article</a> on immigration. The discussion thread has some interesting notes (though, alas, the signal-to-noise seems to be noticeably lower than usual when reading at +5 &#8212; this seems to be quite a politically charged topic). </p>
<p>It reminds me of something that happened two years ago at the <a href="http://www.accu.org/index.php/conferences">ACCU conference</a>. I was on a panel that seemed innocuous enough, until one of the questions raised was immigration: &#8216;Is it a Good Thing or a Bad Thing that people come from other countries in order to do high-tech work here?&#8217; I&#8217;d been peripherally aware that this debate was going on in America, was interested to observe that it was also going on in the UK, and was quite surprised at what a hot button it had become. There sure was a lot of discussion with fervent opinions in both directions. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have an opinion either way on the issue, but I just thought I&#8217;d share an interesting (I hope) observation about perspective, as someone who is from Canada and now lives and works in the United States and thinks well of both places and the people in them: It&#8217;s interesting to me that in America (as in Canada), I have seen concerns like this about immigration and people coming from elsewhere to perform domestic professional jobs. I can understand the feelings behind those concerns. On the other hand, during the 35 years I lived in Canada I saw equally frequent and vocal concerns about emigration and the &quot;brain drain&quot; of professionals leaving Canada for the United States &#8212; notably doctors and high-tech folks, but we did lose a lot of actors too. And Bill Shatner. (Just kidding; I like Shatner.) </p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it interesting that when a skilled person moves, some people in the country they&#8217;re joining are worried that they&#8217;re arriving, and some people in the country that they&#8217;re leaving are equally worried that they&#8217;re going? </p>
<p>Just a thought. Back on Slashdot, though, my favorite comment was: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mr Gates did mention that 640K skilled immigrants ought to be enough for USA.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe till <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">January 18/19, 2038</a>. :-)</p>
