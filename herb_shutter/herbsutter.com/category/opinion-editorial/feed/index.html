								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bjarne Stroustrup wrote the following a few minutes ago on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/?fromgroups#!searchin/concepts/goto$20dijkstra/concepts/IAHQkYcbCDc/nm8W86ozXQYJ">concepts mailing list</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me take this opportunity to remind people that</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;being able to do something is not sufficient reason for doing it&quot; and</li>
<li>&quot;being able to do every trick is not a feature but a bug&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>For the latter, remember Dijkstra&#8217;s famous &quot;Goto considered harmful&quot; paper. The point was not that the &quot;new features&quot; (loop constructs) could do every goto trick better/simpler, but that some of those tricks should be avoided to simplify good programming.</p>
<p>Concepts and concepts lite are meant to make good generic programming simpler. They are not meant to be a drop-in substitute for every metaprogramming and macroprogramming trick. If you are an expert, and if in your expert opinion you and your users really need those tricks, you can still use them, but we need to make many (most) uses of templates easier to get right, so that they can become more mainstream. That where concepts and concept lite fits in.</p>
<p>Some of you may find this hard to believe, but &quot;back then&quot; there was quite serious opposition to function declarations because &quot;they restricted the way functions could be used and the way separate compilation could be used&quot; and also serious opposition to virtual functions &quot;because pointers to functions are so much more flexible.&quot; I see concepts lite (and concepts) in the same light as goto/for, unchecked-function-arguments/function-declarations, pointers-to-functions/abstract-classes.</p>
</blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Atwood’s post two days ago inspired me to write this down. Thanks, Jeff.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“I can&#8217;t even remember the last time I was this excited about a computer.”</em></p>
<p>– <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/11/do-you-wanna-touch.html">Jeff Atwood, November 1, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Our industry is young again, full of the bliss and sense of wonder and promise of adventure that comes with youth.</p>
<p><strong>Computing feels young and fresh</strong> in a way that it hasn’t felt for years, and that has only happened to this degree at two other times in its history. Many old-timers, including myself, have said “this feels like 1980 again.”</p>
<p>It does indeed. And the reason why is all about user interfaces (UI).</p>
<h2>Wave 1: Late 1950s through 60s</h2>
<p>First, computing felt young in the late 1950s through the 60s because it <em>was</em> young, and made computers personally available to a select few people. Having computers at all was new, and the ability to make a machine <em>do </em>things opened up a whole new world for a band of pioneers like Dijkstra and Hoare, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!"><strong>Russell (Spacewar!)</strong></a> and <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2009/01/08/answer-to-16-technologies-engelbart-and-the-mother-of-all-demos/"><strong>Engelbart (Mother of All Demos)</strong></a> who made these computers personal for at least a few people.</p>
<p>The machines were useful. But the excitement came from <em>personally interacting</em> with the machine.</p>
<h2>Wave 2: Late 1970s through 80s</h2>
<p>Second, computing felt young again in the late 1970s and 80s. Then, truly personal single-user computers were new. They opened up to a far wider audience the sense of wonder that came with having a computer of our very own, and often even with a colorful graphical interface to draw us into its new worlds. I’ll include <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure">Woods and Crowther (ADVENT)</a></strong> as an example, because they used a PDP as a personal computer (smile) and their game and many more like it took off on the earliest true PCs – Exidy Sorcerers and TRS-80s, Ataris and Apples. This was the second and much bigger wave of delivering computers we could personally interact with.</p>
<p>The machines were somewhat useful; people kept trying to justify paying $1,000 for one “to organize recipes.” (Really.) But the real reason people wanted them was that they were more intimate – the excitement once again came from <em>personally interacting </em>with the machine.</p>
<h2>Non-wave: 1990s through mid-2000s</h2>
<p>Although WIMP interfaces proliferated in the 1990s and did deliver benefits and usability, they were never as exciting to the degree computers were in the 80s. Why not? Because they weren’t nearly as transformative in making computers more <em>personal</em>, more fun. And then, to add insult to injury, once we shipped WIMPiness throughout the industry, we called it good for a decade and innovation in user interfaces stagnated.</p>
<p>I heard many people wonder whether computing was done, whether this was all there would be. Thanks, Apple, for once again taking the lead in proving them wrong.</p>
<h2>Wave 3: Late 2000s through the 10s</h2>
<p>Now, starting in the late 2000s and through the 10s, modern mobile computers are new and more personal than ever, and they’re just getting started. But what makes them so much more personal? There are three components of the new age of computing, and they’re all about UI (user interfaces)… count ’em:</p>
<ol>
<li>Touch.</li>
<li>Speech.</li>
<li>Gestures.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now don’t get me wrong, these are in addition to keyboards and accurate pointing (mice, trackpads) and writing (pens), not instead of them. I don’t believe for a minute that keyboards and mice and pens are going away, because they’re incredibly useful – I agree with <a href="http://joey.hess.usesthis.com/">Joey Hess</a> (HT to @codinghorror):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“If it doesn’t have a keyboard, I feel that my thoughts are being forced out through a straw.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, touch, speech, and gestures are clearly important. Why? Because <strong>interacting with touch and speech and gestures is how we’re made, and that’s what lets these interactions power a new wave of making computers more personal.</strong> All three are coming to the mainstream in about that order…</p>
<h2>Four predictions</h2>
<p>… and all three aren’t done, they’re just getting started, and we can now see that <strong>at least the first two are inevitable</strong>. Consider:</p>
<p>Touchable screens on smartphones and tablets is just the beginning. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/11/do-you-wanna-touch.html">Once we taste the ability to touch any screen, we immediately want and expect all screens to respond to touch.</a> One year from now, when more people have had a taste of it, no one will question whether notebooks and monitors should respond to touch – though maybe a few will still question touch televisions. Two years from now, <strong>we’ll just assume that every screen should be touchable</strong>, and soon we’ll forget it was ever any other way. Anyone set on building non-touch mainstream screens of any size is on the wrong side of history.</p>
<p>Speech recognition on phones and in the living room is just the beginning. This week I recorded a podcast with <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a> which will air in another week or two, when Scott shared something he observed firsthand in his son: Once a child experiences saying “Xbox Pause,” he will <strong>expect all entertainment devices to respond to speech commands</strong>, and if they don’t they’re “broken.” Two years from now, speech will probably be the norm as one way to deliver primary commands. (Insert <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hShY6xZWVGE">Scotty joke</a> here.)</p>
<p>Likewise, gestures to control entertainment and games in the living room is just the beginning. Over the past year or two, when giving talks I’ve sometimes enjoyed messing with audiences by “changing” a PowerPoint slide by gesturing in the air in front of the screen while really changing the slide with the remote in my pocket. I immediately share the joke, of course, and we all have a laugh together, but the <strong>audience members more and more often just think it’s a new product and expect it to work</strong>. Gestures aren’t just for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)">John Anderton</a> any more.</p>
<p>Bringing touch and speech and gestures to all devices is a thrilling experience. They are just the beginning of the new wave that’s still growing. And this is the most personal wave so far.</p>
<p>This is an exciting and wonderful time to be part of our industry.</p>
<p>Computing is being reborn, again; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv6dMFF_yts">we are young</a> again.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m seeing many younger programmers picking up C++. The average age at C++ events over the past year has been declining rapidly as the audience sizes grow with more and younger people in addition to the C++ veterans.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://www.computeach.co.uk/IT-news/IT-Computer-Technology-News/IT-industry-news-Six-year-old-computer-whiz-aims-for-record/801352474">this one just beats all</a> [Facebook link added]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A six-year-old child from Bangladesh is hoping to be officially recognised as the world&#8217;s youngest computer programmer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Wasik-Farhan-Roopkotha/100000454476401">Wasik Farhan-Roopkotha</a> showed an aptitude for computing at an early age and started typing in Microsoft Word at just three years old, BBC News reports.</p>
<p>The precocious youngster was programming game emulators from the age of four and his achievements have already received extensive media coverage in his home country.</p>
<p>He has also gained knowledge of C++, the programming language developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup, without any formal training.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kid seems pretty exceptional. Welcome, Wasik! I don’t expect the programs to be very complicated, and I’ll leave aside questions of balancing computer time with real-world time and exercise, but this is still quite an achievement.</p>
<p>How young were you when you wrote your first program? I discovered computers for the first time at age 11 when I switched to a new school that had a PET 2001, and wrote my first BASIC programs when was 11 or 12, first on paper and then a little on the PET when I could get access to it. I still fondly remember when I finally got my own Atari 800 when I was 13… thanks again for the loan for that, mum and dad! the first loan I ever took, and paid off in a year with paper-route money. Having that computer was definitely worth a year of predawn paper delivery in the rain, sleet, and snow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/04/24/reader-qa-flash-redux/">answering</a> a reader question about Flash today, I linked to <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/flash-focus.html">Adobe’s November press release</a> and I commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Granted, Adobe says it’s abandoning Flash ‘only for new mobile device browsers while still supporting it for PC browsers.’ This is still a painful statement because [in part] … the distinction between mobile devices and PCs is quickly disappearing as of this year as PCs are becoming fully mobilized.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what’s a “mobile device” vs. a “PC” as of 2012? Here’s a current data point, at least for me.</p>
<p>For almost two weeks now, my current primary machine has been a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/windowspreview/">Slate 7 running Windows 8 Consumer Preview</a>, and I’m extremely pleased with it. It’s a full Windows notebook (sans keyboard), and a full modern tablet. How do I slot it between “mobile device” and “PC,” exactly? Oh, and the desktop browser still supports Flash, but the tablet style browser doesn’t…</p>
<p>Since I’ve been using it (and am using it to write this post), let me write a mini-review.</p>
<p>I loved my iPad, and still do, and so I was surprised how quickly I came to love this snappy device even more. Here are a few thoughts, in rough order from least to most important:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a few nice touches that I miss on iOS, like task switching by simple swipe-from-left (much easier than double-clicking the home button and swiping, and my iPhone home button is started to get unreliable with all the double-clicking <em>[ETA: and I never got used to four-finger swiping probably in part because it isn&#8217;t useful on the iPhone]</em>), having a second app open as a sidebar (which greatly relieves the aforementioned back-and-forth task-switching I find myself doing on iOS to refer to two apps), and some little things like including left- and right-cursor keys on the on-screen keyboard (compared to iOS’s touch-and-hold to position the cursor by finger using the magnification loupe). In general, the on-screen keyboard is not only unspeakably better than Win7’s attempt, but even slightly nicer than iPad’s as I find myself not having to switch keyboards as much to get at common punctuation symbols.</li>
<li>I was happily surprised to find that some of my key web-related apps like Live Writer came already installed.</li>
<li>The App Store, which isn’t even live yet, already had many of my major apps including Kindle, USA Today, and Cut the Rope. Most seem very reliable; a few marked “App Preview” are definitely beta quality at the moment though. The Kindle app is solid and has everything I expected, except for one complaint: It should really go to a two-column layout in landscape mode like it does on iPad, especially given the wider screen. Still, the non-“preview” apps do work, and the experience and content is surprisingly nice for a not-officially-open App Store.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/mobile-news/windows-8-tablets-secret-weapon-onenote-and-inking/6285">Real pen+ink support.</a> This is a Big Deal, <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2010/04/01/links-i-enjoyed-reading-this-week-3/">as I said two years ago</a>. Yes, I’ve tried several iPad pens and apps for sort-of-writing notes, and no, iOS has nothing comparable here; the best I can say for the very best of them is that they’re like using crayons. Be sure to try real “ink” before claiming otherwise – if you haven’t, you don’t know what you’re missing. iPad does have other good non-pen annotation apps, and I’ve enjoyed using <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iannotate-pdf/id363998953?mt=8">iAnnotate PDF</a> extensively to read and annotate almost half of <a href="http://erdani.com/index.php/books/tdpl/">Andrei’s D book</a>. But for reading articles and papers I just really, really miss pen+ink.</li>
<li>All my software just works, from compilers and editors to desktop apps for full Office and other work.</li>
<li>Therefore, finally, I get my desktop environment and my modern tablet environment <strong>without carrying two devices</strong>. My entire environment, from apps to files, is always there without syncing between notebook and tablet devices, and I can finally eliminate a device. I expected I would do that this year, but I’m pleasantly surprised to be able to do it for real already this early in the year with a beta OS and beta app store.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t expect to switch over to it this quickly, but within a few days of getting it I just easily switched to reading my current book-in-progress on this device while traveling (thanks to the Kindle app), reading and pen-annotating a couple of research papers on lock-free coding techniques (it’s by far my favorite OneNote device ever thanks to having both great touch and great pen+ink and light weight so I can just <em>write</em>), and using it both as a notebook and as a tablet without having to switch devices (just docking when I’m at my desk and using the usual large monitors and <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB110LL/B">my favorite keyboard</a>+mouse, or holding it and using touch+pen only). It already feels like a dream and very familiar both ways. I’m pretty sure I’ll never go back to a traditional clamshell notebook, ever.</p>
<p>Interestingly, as a side benefit, even the desktop apps are often very, and more, usable when in pure tablet+touch mode than before despite the apparently-small targets. Those small targets do sometimes matter, and I occasionally reach for my pen when using those on my lap. But I’ve found in practice they often don’t matter at all when you swipe to scroll a large region – I was surprised to find myself happily using Outlook in touch-only mode. In particular, it’s my favorite OneNote device ever.</p>
<p>By the end of this week when I install a couple of more apps, including the rest of my test C++ compilers, <strong>it will have fully replaced my previous notebook and my previous tablet, with roughly equal price and power as the former alone (4GB RAM, 128GB SSD + Micro SD slot, Intel Core i5-2467M) and roughly equal weight and touch friendliness as the latter alone (1.98lb vs. 1.44lb).</strong> Dear Windows team, my back thanks you.</p>
<p>So, then, returning to the point – in our very near future, how much sense does it really make to <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/flash-focus.html">distinguish between browsers for “mobile devices” and “PCs,”</a> anyway? Convergence is already upon us and is only accelerating.</p>

<blockquote><p>@Tom @Herb: What’s so wrong with flash that it should be boycotted? Have I been being abused by it in some way I’m not aware of? Also,does HTML5 have any bearing on the subject?</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not saying it should be boycotted, only that I avoid it. Here&#8217;s what I wrote two years ago: <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2010/03/30/flash-in-the-pan/">“Flash In the Pan”</a>.  Besides security issues and crashing a lot, Flash is a headache for servicing and seems to be architecturally unsuited for lower-power environments.</p>
<p>Since then, two more major developments:</p>
<h3>1. Even Adobe has given ground (if not given up).</h3>
<p>Adobe subsequently <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/flash-focus.html">abandoned Flash for mobile browsers</a> and started shipping <a href="http://html.adobe.com/">straight-to-HTML5 tools</a>.</p>
<p>Granted, Adobe says it’s abandoning Flash ‘only for new mobile device browsers while still supporting it for PC browsers.’ This is still a painful statement because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s obvious that ceding such <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/networking/flash-is-dead-long-live-html5/1633">high-profile</a> and <a href="http://www.imore.com/2010/04/29/adobe-ceo-responds-steve-jobs-open-letter/">hard-fought</a> ground sends a message about overall direction; and</li>
<li>the distinction between mobile devices and PCs is quickly disappearing as of this year as PCs are becoming fully mobilized (more on this in my next blog post).</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. We’re moving toward plugin-avoiding browsing.</h3>
<p>Browsers are increasingly moving to reduce plugins, or eliminate them outright, for security/reliability/servicing reasons. Moving in that direction crease pressure or necessity to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>ban Flash (Mobile Safari, and <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20105870-264/microsoft-joins-the-anti-flash-crowd-with-ie10/">Metro style Internet Explorer 10</a>); or</li>
<li>deliver Flash built into the browser itself (even for plugin-allowing browsers <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=108086">like Chrome</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not saying Flash will die off immediately or necessarily even die off entirely at all; there’s a lot of inertia, it’s still useful in many kinds of devices, and it may well hang on for some time. But its architectural problems and current trajectory are fairly clear, and it’s been months since I’ve heard someone complain that certain people were just <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">being unfair</a> – Jobs’ technical points are on the right side of history.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With so much happening in the computing world, now seemed like the right time to write <a href="https://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle/"><strong>“Welcome to the Jungle”</strong></a><strong> </strong>– a sequel to my earlier “The Free Lunch Is Over” essay. Here’s the introduction:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong><a href="https://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle/">Welcome to the Jungle</a></strong></h3>
<p align="center"><em>In the twilight of Moore’s Law, the transitions to multicore processors, GPU computing, and HaaS cloud computing are not separate trends, but aspects of a single trend – mainstream computers from desktops to ‘smartphones’ are being permanently transformed into heterogeneous supercomputer clusters. Henceforth, a single compute-intensive application will need to harness different kinds of cores, in immense numbers, to get its job done.</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>The free lunch is over. Now welcome to the hardware jungle.</em></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>From 1975 to 2005, our industry accomplished a phenomenal mission: In 30 years, we put a personal computer on every desk, in every home, and in every pocket.</p>
<p>In 2005, however, mainstream computing hit a wall. In <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm"><strong>“The Free Lunch Is Over”</strong> (December 2004)</a>, I described the reasons for the then-upcoming industry transition from single-core to multi-core CPUs in mainstream machines, why it would require changes throughout the software stack from operating systems to languages to tools, and why it would permanently affect the way we as software developers have to write our code if we want our applications to continue exploiting Moore’s transistor dividend.</p>
<p>In 2005, our industry undertook a new mission: to put a personal parallel supercomputer on every desk, in every home, and in every pocket. 2011 was special: it’s the year that we completed the transition to parallel computing in all mainstream form factors, with the arrival of multicore tablets (e.g., iPad 2, Playbook, Kindle Fire, Nook Tablet) and smartphones (e.g., Galaxy S II, Droid X2, iPhone 4S). 2012 will see us continue to build out multicore with mainstream quad- and eight-core tablets (as Windows 8 brings a modern tablet experience to x86 as well as ARM), <a href="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/image_thumb99.png"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:inline;float:right;padding-top:0;border-width:0;margin:20px 0 0 10px;" title="image_thumb99" border="0" alt="image_thumb99" align="right" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/image_thumb99_thumb.png?w=480&#038;h=228" width="480" height="228" /></a>and the last single-core gaming console holdout will go multicore (as Nintendo’s Wii U replaces Wii).</p>
<p>This time it took us just six years to deliver mainstream parallel computing in all popular form factors. And we know the transition to multicore is permanent, because multicore delivers compute performance that single-core cannot and there will always be mainstream applications that run better on a multi-core machine. There’s no going back.</p>
<p>For the first time in the history of computing, mainstream hardware is no longer a single-processor von Neumann machine, and never will be again.</p>
<p><em>That was the first act.&#160; . . .</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">.</span></p>
<p>What is built becomes our future<br />
Hand-constructed, stone by stone<br />
Quarried by our elders&#8217; labors<br />
Fashioned with their strength and bone<br />
Dare to dream, and dare to conquer<br />
Fears by building castles grand<br />
But ne&#8217;er forget, and e&#8217;er remember<br />
To take a new step we must stand<br />
On the shoulders of our giants<br />
Who, seeing off into the morrow,<br />
Made the dreams of past turn truth &#8212;<br />
How their passing is our sorrow.</p>

<p>What a sad, horrible month. First <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2011/10/06/steve-jobs/">Steve Jobs</a>, then <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2011/10/12/dennis-ritchie/">Dennis Ritchie</a>, and now John McCarthy. We are losing many of the greats all at once.</p>
<p>If you haven’t heard of John McCarthy, you’re probably learning about his many important contributions now. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>He’s the inventor of Lisp, the second-oldest high-level programming language, younger than Fortran by just one year. Lisp is one of the most influential programming languages in history. Granted, however, most programmers don’t use directly Lisp-based languages, so its great influence has been mostly indirect.</li>
<li>He coined the term “artificial intelligence.” Granted, however, AI has got a bad rap from being oversold by enthusiasts like Minsky; for the past 20 years or so it’s been safer to talk in euphemisms like “expert systems.” So here too McCarthy’s great influence has been less direct.</li>
<li>He developed the idea of time-sharing, the first step toward multitasking. Okay, now we’re talking about a contribution that’s pretty directly influential to our modern systems and lives.</li>
</ul>
<p>But perhaps McCarthy’s most important single contribution to modern computer science is still something else, yet another major technology you won’t hear nearly enough about as being his invention:</p>
<p><strong>Automatic garbage collection. </strong>Which he invented circa 1959.</p>
<p>No, really, that’s not a typo: <strong>1959.</strong> For context, that year’s first quarter alone saw the beginning of the space age as Sputnik 1 came down at the end of its three-month orbit; Fidel Castro take Cuba; Walt Disney release <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Music_Died">The Day the Music Died</a>; the first Barbie doll; and President Eisenhower signing a bill to enable Hawaii to become a state.</p>
<p>GC is <em>ancient</em>. Electronic computers with core memory were still something of a novelty (RAM didn’t show up until a decade or so later), machine memory was measured in scant kilobytes, and McCarthy was already managing those tiny memories with automatic garbage collection.</p>
<p>I’ve encountered people who think GC was invented by Java in 1995. It was actually invented more than half a century ago, when our industry barely even existed.</p>
<p>Thanks, John.</p>
<p>And here’s hoping we can take a break for a while from writing these memorials to our giants.</p>

<p>Dennis Ritchie gave very few interviews, but I was lucky enough to be able to get one of them.</p>
<p>Back in 2000, when I was editor of <em>C++ Report</em>, I interviewed the creators of C, C++, and Java all together:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span style="color:#006666;font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica;"><a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/c_family_interview.htm">The C Family of Languages: Interview with Dennis Ritchie, Bjarne Stroustrup, and James Gosling</a></span></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#008080;">This article appeared in <strong>Java Report, 5(7), July 2000</strong> and <strong>C++ Report, 12(7), July/August 2000</strong>.</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Their extensive comments &#8212; on everything from language history and design (of course) and industry context and crystal-ball prognostication, to personal preferences and war stories and the first code they ever wrote &#8212; are well worth re-reading and remarkably current now, some 11 years on.</p>
<p>As far as I know, it&#8217;s the only time these three have spoken together. It&#8217;s also the only time a feature article ran simultaneously in both <em>C++ Report</em> and <em>Java Report</em>.</p>
<p>Grab a cup of coffee, fire up your tablet, and enjoy.</p>

<p>What a sad week.</p>
<p>Rob Pike <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/2/101960720994009339267/posts/ENuEDDYfvKP?hl=en">reports</a> that Dennis Ritchie also has passed away. Ritchie was one of the pioneers of computer science, and a well-deserved Turing winner for his many contributions, notably the creation of C &#8212; by far the most influential programming language in history, and still going strong today.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Aside: Speaking of &#8220;still going strong,&#8221; this is a landmark week for the ISO Standard C Programming Language as well. Just a couple of days ago, the new C standard passed what turned out to be its final ballot,[*] and so <strong>we now have the new ISO C11 standard</strong>. C11 includes a number of new features that parallel those in C++11, notably a memory model and a threads/mutexes/atomics concurrency library that is tightly aligned with C++11. The new C standard should be published by ISO in the coming weeks.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">[*] ISO rules are that if you pass the penultimate ballot with unanimous international support, you get to skip the formality of the final ballot and proceed directly to publication.</p>
<p>Bjarne Stroustrup made an eloquent point about the importance of Ritchie&#8217;s contributions to our field: <strong><em>&#8220;They said it couldn&#8217;t be done, and he did it.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Bjarne meant:</p>
<p>Before C, there was far more hardware diversity than we see in the industry today. Computers proudly sported not just deliciously different and offbeat instruction sets, but varied wildly in almost everything, right down to even things as fundamental as character bit widths (8 bits per byte doesn&#8217;t suit you? how about 9? or 7? or how about sometimes 6 and sometimes 12?) and memory addressing (don&#8217;t like 16-bit pointers? how about 18-bit pointers, and oh by the way those aren&#8217;t pointers to bytes, they&#8217;re pointers to words?).</p>
<p>There was no such thing as a general-purpose program that was both portable across a variety of hardware and also efficient enough to compete with custom code written for just that hardware. Fortran did okay for array-oriented number-crunching code, but nobody could do it for general-purpose code such as what you&#8217;d use to build just about anything down to, oh, say, an operating system.</p>
<p>So this young upstart whippersnapper comes along and decides to try to specify a language that will let people write programs that are: (a) high-level, with structures and functions; (b) portable to just about any kind of hardware; and (c) efficient on that hardware so that they&#8217;re competitive with handcrafted nonportable custom assembler code on that hardware. A high-level, portable, efficient systems programming language.</p>
<p>How silly. <em>Everyone</em> knew it couldn&#8217;t be done.</p>
<p>C is a poster child for why it&#8217;s essential to keep those people who know a thing can&#8217;t be done from bothering the people who are doing it. (And keep them out of the way while the same inventors, being anything but lazy and always in search of new problems to conquer, go on to use the world&#8217;s first portable and efficient programming language to build the world&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">first portable operating system</a>, not knowing that was impossible too.)</p>
<p>Thanks, Dennis.</p>

<p>Today our industry is much less than it was yesterday. We have lost one of the great innovators. Even more importantly, Steve Jobs&#8217; family has lost a husband and brother and father, and our thoughts are with them.</p>
<p>What can be said that hasn&#8217;t been said? Steve has been arguably the single most influential driver and shaper of personal computing in every one of its five decades, from the 1970s to the 2010s. It&#8217;s obviously true for the 1970s (Apple, Apple ][) and 1980s (Mac). As for the 1990s, it should be enough that the Mac shaped essentially all of that decade&#8217;s desktop and notebook platforms, and icing on the cake that technologies pioneered at NeXT and Pixar so heavily influenced personal gaming and other personal computing. In the 2000s, suffice it to say that Steve put the personal  <em><strong>i</strong></em>  into modern computing and again transformed this industry, and other industries. Looking forward, absent some other world-changing event, it&#8217;s clear that the rest of the 2010s will see personal computing develop along the trail he and his teams have blazed already in this decade.</p>
<p>Here is a measure of a man&#8217;s impact: Imagine how different &#8212; how diminished &#8212; the world would be today if Steve had passed away ten years ago.</p>
<p>Makes our hearts fade a little, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Now imagine how different &#8212; how much more &#8212; the world would be if Steve had lived another ten years.</p>
<p>Or another twenty. Or another fifty, as though what we have seen were but the first half of his life &#8212; and if the second half were not as a slowly aging, diminishing man, but with his health and strength and faculties as strong as ever for that much more time, a true fifty more years.</p>
<p>We are all cut down too soon.</p>
<p>Thanks, Steve.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking as a neutral observer with exactly zero opinion on any political question, and not even a cyberpunk reader given that I&#8217;ve read about two such novels in my life: Is it just me, or do the last few months&#8217; global news headlines read like they were ghostwritten by <a href="http://www.nealstephenson.com/">Neal Stephenson</a>?</p>
<p>I wonder if we may look back on 2010 as the year it became widely understood that we now live in a cyberpunk world. Many of 2010&#8217;s top stories read like sci-fi:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stuxnet:</strong> Sovereign nations (apparently) carry out <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/11/stuxnet-sabotage-centrifuges/">successful attacks</a> on each other with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">surgically crafted malware</a> &#8212; viruses and worms that target specific nuclear facilities, possibly causing more damage and delay to their targets&#8217; weapons programs than might have been achieved with a conventional military strike.</li>
<li><strong>Wikileaks:</strong> <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2010/12/half-formed-thought-on-wikileaks-global-action/">Stateless &#8216;Net organizations</a> operating outside national laws fight information battles with major governments, up to and including the strongest industrial and military superpowers. The governments react by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/dec/01/wikileaks-website-cables-servers-amazon">applying political pressure to powerful multinational corporations</a> to try to force the stateless organizations off the &#8216;Net and cut off their support and funding, but these efforts succeed only temporarily as the target keeps moving and reappearing.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymous:</strong> Small vigilante groups of private cybergunners retaliate by (or just latch onto a handy excuse to go) carrying out global attacks on the websites of multinational corporations, inflicting enough damage on <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/12/08/news/companies/mastercard_wiki/index.htm">Visa and Mastercard</a> to temporarily take them off the &#8216;Net, while being <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/12/09/technology/amazon_wikileaks_attack/index.htm">repelled by cyberfortresses like Amazon</a> and Paypal that have stronger digital defenses. But before we get too confident about Amazon&#8217;s strength, remember that this definitely ain&#8217;t the biggest attack they&#8217;ll ever see, just a 21st-century-cyberwar <em>hors d&#8217;oeuvre: </em>Who were these global attackers? About 100 people, many of them teenagers.</li>
<li><strong>Assange:</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange">Charismatic cyberpersonalities</a> operating principally on the &#8216;Net live as permanent residents of no nation, and roam the world (until arrested) wherever they can jack in, amid <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=assassinate+assange">calls for their arrest and/or assassination</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Kinect:</strong> Your benevolent (you hope) living room game console <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvvQJxgykcU">can see you</a>. Insert obligatory <em>Minority Report UIs no longer sci-fi</em> line here, with optional reference to <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a></em>.</li>
<li><strong>Other:</strong> Never mind that organized crime has for years now been well-known to be behind much of the phishing, spam, <a href="http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/articles.php?art_id=3199">card skimming</a>, and other electronic and &#8216;Net crimes. Not new to 2010, but seeing a significant uptick in the continued transition from boutique crime to serious organization and <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2009/april/spearphishing_040109">spear-phishing</a> targeting specific high-profile organizations <a href="http://www.securitynewsdaily.com/phishing-scam-targets-us-military-0252/">including the U.S. military</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the coming months and years, it will be interesting to see how multinational corporations and sovereign governments react to what some of them no doubt view as a new stateless &#8212; transnational? extranational? supernational? &#8212; and therefore global threat to their normal way of doing business.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Inquirer isn’t normally this silly, and it isn’t even April 1. Nick Farrell writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/opinion/1635335/why-apple-regret-ipad">Why Apple might regret the Ipad</a> [sic]</h3>
<p><strong>THE IPAD HAS DOOMED</strong> Apple, according to market anlaysts [sic] that are expecting the tablet to spell trouble for its maker. … Rather than killing off the netbook, the Ipad [sic] is harming sales of the Ipod [sic] and Macbooks… if the analysts are right the Ipad [sic] has killed the Ipod [sic] Touch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just silly, for four reasons. Three are obvious:</p>
<ul>
<li>The iPod Touch fits in your pocket and can be easily with you all the time. Nothing bigger can ever kill it, but only replace it for a subset of users who don’t need in-pocket portability. (Besides, even if all iPod Touch buyers bought an iPad instead, the latter is more expensive and so the correct term would be not “kill” but “upsell”.)</li>
<li>The laptop has a real keyboard and full applications. Nothing not full-featured can ever kill it, but only replace it for a subset of users who don’t need the richer experience and applications.</li>
<li>Even if it was killing the other business outright, which it isn’t, it’s always better to eat your own lunch than wait for a competitor to do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the fourth reason it’s silly? Let’s be very clear: The iPad has sold <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/05/03ipad.html">1 million units in its first 28 days</a>. At $500-700 a pop, that means <strong>the iPad is becoming a new billion-dollar business in two months.</strong></p>
<p>Nick, I don’t think “regret” is the word you’re looking for.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These are the two best links I’ve read in the wake of the Flash and HTML5 brouhaha(s). They discuss other informative points too, but their biggest value lies in discussing three things, to which I’ll offer the answers that make the most sense to me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is the web, really?</strong> “The web” is the <em>cross-linked content</em>, regardless of what in-browser/PC-based/phone-based generator/viewer/app is used to produce it and/or consume it. </li>
<li><strong>Does web == in-browser?</strong> No. Native apps can be web apps just as much so as in-browser ones, and increasingly many native apps are web apps. Conversely, not everything that runs in a browser is part of the web, even though most of them are for the obvious historical reasons.</li>
<li><strong>Is it necessary/desirable/possible to make in-browser apps be like native apps?</strong> No, maybe, and maybe. The jury is still out, but at the moment developers are still trying while some pundits keep decrying.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the two articles.</p>
<h3><a href="http://benward.me/blog/understand-the-web"><strong>Understand the Web</strong></a><strong> (Ben Ward)</strong></h3>
<p>This rambly piece needs serious editing, but is nevertheless very informative. Much of the debate about Flash and/or HTML5 conflates two things: the web, and application development platforms. They aren’t the same thing, and in fact are mostly orthogonal. From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think about that word; ‘web’. Think about why it was so named. It’s nothing to do with rich applications. Everything about web architecture; HTTP, HTML, CSS, is designed to serve and render content, but <em>most importantly</em> the web is formed where all of that content is linked together. That is what makes it amazing, and that is what defines it.</p>
<p><em>… [in the confused Flash and HTML5 debates] </em>We’re talking about two very different things: The web of information and content, and a desire for a free, cross-platform Cocoa or .NET quality application framework that runs in the browsers people already use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a different note, speaking of the desire for super-rich in-browser apps, he adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally, aside from all of this almost ideological disagreement over what the web is for, and what you can reasonably expect it to be good at, I honestly think that ‘Desktop-class Web Applications’ are a fools folly. Java, Flash, AIR and QT demonstrate right now that cross-platform applications are <em>always</em> inferior to the functionality and operation of the native framework on a host platform. Steve Jobs is right in his comments that third-party frameworks are an obstacle to native functionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/05/05/HTML5-and-the-Web"><strong>HTML5 and the Web</strong></a><strong> (Tim Bray)</strong></h3>
<p>Again, what “the web” is – and it has nothing specifically to do with HTML. From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Web is a tripod, depending critically on three architectural principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pieces of the Web, which we call Resources, are identified by short strings of characters called “URIs”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work is accomplished by exchanging messages, which comprise metadata and representations of Resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The representations are expressed in a number of well-defined data formats; you can count on the message data to tell you which one is in use. It is essential that some of the representation formats be capable of containing URIs. The “Web” in WWW is that composed by the universe of Resources linked by the URIs in their representations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all. You notice that there’s nothing there that depends crucially on any flavor of HTML. Speaking only for myself, an increasingly large proportion of my Web experience arrives in the form of feed entries and Twitter posts; not HTML at all, but 100% part of the Web.</p>
<p><strong>On Flash</strong> · This may be a side-trip, but anyhow: I entirely loathe Flash but by any definition it’s part of the Web. It works just fine as a resource representation and it can contain URI hyperlinks.</p>
<p>… <strong>Native Applications</strong> · A large proportion of the native applications on iPhone, and on Android, and on Windows, and on Mac, and on Linux, are Web applications. They depend in a fundamental way on being able to recognize and make intelligent use of hyperlinks and traverse the great big wonderful Web.</p>
<p>… So whatever you may think of native applications, please don’t try to pretend that they are (or are not) necessarily good citizens of the Web. Being native (or not) has nothing to do with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good stuff.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you like reading just about anything on the web, including my articles, in a pretty nicely rendered plain format with no ads or other distractions, you might want to try out arc90’s <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/"><strong>Readability</strong></a>.</p>
<p>All you do is drag a bookmarklet to your bookmark bar, and then on any article-like web page you can click on the bookmarklet to turn this:</p>
<p><a href="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/image2.png"><img title="image" style="border-right:0;border-top:0;display:inline;border-left:0;border-bottom:0;" height="240" alt="image" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/image_thumb2.png?w=213&#038;h=240" width="213" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>into this (with a few choices each for font, size, and margin):</p>
<p><a href="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/image3.png"><img title="image" style="border-right:0;border-top:0;display:inline;border-left:0;border-bottom:0;" height="240" alt="image" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/image_thumb3.png?w=213&#038;h=240" width="213" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>This lets you gain a lot in readability when all you want to do is read the article itself with basic text and graphics rendered fairly nicely. You do lose a little formatting, such as colored text which I sometimes use in my articles’ code examples, but the overall effect is pretty nice.</p>
<p>I’ll keep trying Readability out, especially on smaller-than-desktop screens, to see if it’s a keeper. So far the overall effect is pretty nice. Thanks to <a href="http://www.jamesphogan.com/bb/bulletin.php?id=1181">James P. Hogan</a> for the tip, even if the link his page gives is broken.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Note: If you’re using Mobile Safari (i.e., iPhone or iPad) you’ll need to do a little bit more work because that software doesn’t currently support dragging the bookmarklet to its bookmark bar. Fortunately, there’s a workaround:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the Javascript code. I just made the bookmarklet on a desktop browser and copied the code from there to an email to myself (some things are faster with a keyboard and mouse). Alternatively you can inspect the HTML using <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/html-viewer/id353546393?mt=8">HTML Viewer</a> right on the same device as Mobile Safari and cut-and-paste from that.</li>
<li>In Mobile Safari, make a new bookmarklet.</li>
<li>Edit it, and paste the Javascript code as the URL.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>As has been true since the early Mac days in the 1980s, Apple products and SDKs make every piece of functionality either super easy if it’s supported, or super painful if it’s not. :-)</p>
<p><em>Pre-emptive snarky comment: Yes, I know some people will retort that Microsoft and Linux products are better, because at least they consistently make everything super painful all of the time… but I think that’s only half true.</em></p>

First <a href="http://www.youtube.com/html5">YouTube</a>, and now <a href="http://twitter.com/tedchris/status/11198778730">TED</a>, <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/blog:268">Vimeo</a>, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5501732/cbs-website-shows-html5-testing-for-ipad">CBS</a>, and <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2010/03/brightcove-adds-html5--more-video-for-the-ipad/1"><em>Time</em> and <em>The New York Times</em></a> are adding support for HTML5 in addition to, or instead of, Flash.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve lately come to dislike Flash for personal reasons. Specifically, the Shockwave Player plugin is buggy and keeps hanging Chrome in particular and costing me a few minutes every few days while I wait for the &#8220;want to kill this plugin?&#8221; dialog to come up. It&#8217;s not the end of the world, just an annoyance. But it is annoying.</p>
<p style="margin-left:36pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;"><em>Aside: This seemed to start, or at least get a lot more frequent, around the time I installed Windows 7, which means we can have many interesting discussions about who broke whom. However, in searching around I see on Web forums there&#8217;s been a lot of chatter about Shockwave Player crashes on multiple browsers and OSes.<br />
</em></span></p>
<p>But given that the world is starting to move on anyway, and because I like to tinker, I wondered what &#8220;the Web without Flash&#8221; would look like on my PC. I already know what it looks like on my iPhone, but the PC gets heaver use and I generally use it to visit richer sites.</p>
<p>So yesterday I decided to take the plunge and uninstall Flash entirely. Flash used to be a <em>de rigueur</em> add-on. Now I&#8217;ll see what the Web is like without it.</p>
<p>So far, so good. My Machine Architecture talk on Google Video doesn&#8217;t play, but other than that the main difference is just that I see less distracting content and that I get a cute little bar at the top of many pages asking me to install a plugin to fully display the page; dismissing the bar only lasts for the duration of the page, but I find that the bar quickly fades into the background of consciousness.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see how long I can last <em>sans</em> Flash.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month’s <strong>Effective Concurrency</strong> column, <a href="http://www.ddj.com/go-parallel/article/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=219200099">Design for Manycore Systems</a>, is now live on DDJ’s website.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Why worry about “manycore” today?</em></p>
<p>Dual- and quad-core computers are obviously here to stay for mainstream desktops and notebooks. But do we really need to think about &quot;many-core&quot; systems if we&#8217;re building a typical mainstream application right now? I find that, to many developers, &quot;many-core&quot; systems still feel fairly remote, and not an immediate issue to think about as they&#8217;re working on their current product.</p>
<p>This column is about why it&#8217;s time right now for most of us to think about systems with lots of cores. In short: Software is the (only) gating factor; as that gate falls, hardware parallelism is coming more and sooner than many people yet believe. …</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just saw a CNN headline that read: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/business/2009/02/04/chang.china.living.cheap.cnn">“Young workers scrimp to live on $15/wk.”</a> Before reading further, what do you think: Is that stunning and shocking? Or shockingly typical?</p>
<p>The story turned out to be a piece about white-collar workers in China trying to live frugally, spending only 100 Yuan on travel and food during the workweek to conserve funds. Of course, the workers’ actual total expenses and income are higher, because that $15/week figure doesn’t include weekend expenses and other major costs like rent. Even so, the story is considered newsworthy here, and is probably a shock to a number of readers in the western world.</p>
<p>But the headline wouldn’t surprise readers who are familiar with the approximate distribution of income/GDP/wealth in the world.</p>
<p>To illustrate, here are two personal data points from 2006, when my wife and I traveled to Kenya and Zambia to visit friends:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Income:</strong> In <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/country/ke-kenya/eco-economy">Kenya</a>, we were told that being a staff worker at a safari lodge is considered a good job. What does it pay? About $2 per day, for long hours and six-day weeks. This isn’t unusual; in about 30 countries, including Kenya, more than half of the population <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_pop_und_2_a_day-economy-population-under-2-day">earns under $2 per day</a>. <strong>An estimated two billion people – 30% of the world’s population – live on an income of less than $3 per day.</strong> And $3 per day is about what the attention-grabbing CNN headline implies, though the actual story behind that headline is much less bad.</li>
<li><strong>Cost of living:</strong> But what happens when we consider, not just dollar-for-dollar comparisons, but purchasing power? Isn’t it less expensive to live in less-developed countries? Yes, it usually is, especially for shelter and services – there’s been some talk lately on the U.S. news about retiring in Mexico as a way for older people to save money in this economy – but the difference for the same quality goods is often less than one might think. In Lusaka, the capital of <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/country/za-zambia/eco-economy">Zambia</a>, we found there were only three grocery stores [*] having similar goods to what we would expect to find in a U.S.-style Safeway, although of course the Zambian stores were much smaller than U.S. stores (more the size of a medium Trader Joe’s) and offered far less selection diversity (something like a factor of 20 fewer varieties or brands). When we visited one of the stores, I picked up a few Western-style items, totaled the price and converted to U.S. dollars in my head, and found that those <strong>comparable products in Lusaka cost nearly the same as we would have paid for the same items in Seattle</strong>. Our local friend replied: “Right, nobody who lives here would ever think of buying a can of soda pop.” Certainly not when a can of <a href="http://www.pepsi.com/">Coke</a> costs a day’s wage for many people, and doesn’t confer any significant nutritional benefit. </li>
</ul>
<p>The gulf between the western- and world-median standards of living is, simply put, vast – and growing. The standard of living that’s normal for most of the planet’s population is well nigh unimaginable to many of us in the western world, and even for those of us who’ve been there, it’s one thing to see it and quite another to really understand what such a life would be like. I don’t claim to.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>[*] They might well be the only such stores in the country, not just the capital.</p>

In brief, they were:</p>
<ul>
<li>The personal computer for dedicated individual use all day long.
<li>The mouse.
<li>Internetworks.
<li>Network service discovery.
<li>Live collaboration and desktop/app sharing.
<li>Hierarchical structure within a file system and within a document.

<li>Advanced pattern search and macro search.
<li>Keyword search and multiple weighted keyword search.
<li>Catalog-based information retrieval.
<li>Flexible interactive formatting and line drawing.
<li>Hyperlinks within a document and across documents.
<li>Tagging graphics, and parts of graphics, as hyperlinks.
<li>Shared workgroup document collaboration with annotations etc.
<li><em>Live</em> shared workgroup collaboration with live audio/video teleconference in a window. </li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>A single answer to all of the above: </strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Engelbart"><strong>Doug Engelbart</strong></a><strong> and his ARC team, in what is now known as </strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos"><strong>&#8220;The Mother of All Demos&#8221;</strong></a><strong>, on Monday, December 9, 1968.</strong></h4>
<p><img style="margin:0 0 0 10px;" height="387" src="https://i1.wp.com/sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/dce1968conferenceannouncement.jpg" width="290" align="right">Last month, we marked the 40th anniversary of the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">Engelbart Demo</a>, a truly unique &#8220;Eureka!&#8221; moment in the history of computing. 40 years go, Engelbart and his visionary team foresaw &#8212; <em>and prototyped and demonstrated</em> &#8212; many essential details of what we take for granted as our commonplace computing environment today, including all of the above-listed technologies, most of them demonstrated for the first time in that talk.</p>
<p>This talk would be noteworthy and historic just for being the first time a &#8220;mouse&#8221; was shown and called by that name. Yet the mouse was just one of over a dozen important innovations to be compellingly presented with working prototype implementations.</p>
<p>Note: Yes, some of the individual technologies have earlier theoretical roots. I deliberately phrased the question to focus on implementations because <strong>it&#8217;s great to imagine a new idea, but it isn&#8217;t engineering until we prove it can work by actually building it.</strong> For example, consider hypertext: Vannevar Bush&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a>, vintage 1945, was a theorectical &#8220;proto-hypertext&#8221; system but it unfortunately remained theoretical, understandably so given the nascent state of computers at the time. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Project Xanadu</a>, started in 1960, pursued similar ideas but wasn&#8217;t demonstrated until 1972. The Engelbart Demo was the first time that hypertext was publicly shown in a working form, together with a slew of other important working innovations that combined to deliver an unprecedented <em>tour de force</em>. What made it compelling wasn&#8217;t just the individual ideas, but the working demonstrations to show that the ideas worked and how they could combine and interact in wonderful ways.</p>
<h4><strong>Recommended viewing</strong></h4>
<p>You can watch the 100-minute talk <a href="http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite/1968Demo.html">here (Stanford University)</a> in sections with commentary, and <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8734787622017763097">here (Google Video)</a> all in one go.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We enjoy such an abundance of computing riches that it&#8217;s easy to take wonderful technological ideas for granted. Yet so many of the pieces of our modern computing experience that we consider routine today were at one time unimaginable. After all, back in the early days of computing, we were still discovering what these newfangled room-filling gadgets might eventually become capable of &#8212; who could have known then what using computers would be like today?</p>
<p>Of course, we have these technologies today because some visionaries did know, did imagine them&#8230; and, best of all, built and demonstrated them.</p>
<p>Hence today&#8217;s challenge:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008040;"><strong>Quiz: </strong>For each of the following 16 technologies that have become commonplace in our modern computing experience, give the researcher/team and approximate year that a working prototype was first demonstrated. How many can you answer <em>without</em> a web search?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The personal computer</strong> for dedicated individual use, that one person can have at their disposal all day long. <em>(Hint: Before the </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800"><em>Altair</em></a><em> in 1975 and </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I"><em>Apple I</em></a><em> in 1976.)</em></li>
<li><strong>Mouse input with a graphical pointer.</strong> <em>(Hint: Before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto">Xerox Alto</a> at Xerox PARC in 1973.)</em></li>
<li><strong>Internetworks</strong> across campuses and cities. <em>(Hint: Before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a> at Xerox PARC (again) in 1973.)</em></li>
<li><strong>Discovery of &#8216;who&#8217;s got what service&#8217; in an internetwork.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Using internetworks for live collaboration</strong>, not just file sharing. <em>(Hint: Before </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Connection#Remote_Desktop_Connection"><em>RDP</em></a><em> and </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_remote_desktop_software"><em>others</em></a><em>.)</em></li>
<li><strong>Hierarchical structure</strong> within a file system and within a document. <em>(Hint: Before </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix"><em>Unix</em></a><em>.)</em></li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[edited 2009.01.15 to add link to DDJ&#8217;s announcement]</em></p>
<p>2008 was quite a year, full of landmark events that were certainly historic, if not always welcome.</p>
<p>If I had to pick one technology-related highlight from the past year, it would be this: A notable inflection point in the ongoing shift from traditional media to the web. Given that that tide is still in progress, why single out 2008? <strong>I think we&#8217;ll look back at 2008, especially the fourth quarter, as a turning point when the web became an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-list">A-list</a> media outlet and first started to beat up, and even replace, major legacy competitors in newspapers, technical magazines, movies, and TV.</strong> An inflection point, if you will, where the web clearly stopped being the pencil-necked upstart, and visibly emerged as the new <a href="http://www.constitutionlive.com/wp-content/uploads/mostwanted_lou.jpg">gorilla</a> flexing its advertising-revenue-pumped-up muscles and kicking sand on the others.</p>
<p>In 2008, and particularly in the last month, the web began to outright replace some existing newspapers and technology and programming magazines.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>December 2008: The first two major city newspapers go web-only or web-mostly.</strong> <a href="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081216/METRO/812160419">The Detroit News</a> and <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20081216/FREEPRESS/81216032">The Detroit Free Press</a> announced truncated print editions and reduced print delivery. Newspapers in several other cities seem likely to follow fairly soon.</li>
<li><strong>As of January 2009: <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/">PC Magazine</a> is <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2335009,00.asp">going &#8220;digital only.&#8221;</a></strong> After the January issue, the print magazine will disappear. Instead, the content will appear exclusively on the web.</li>
<li><strong>As of January 2009: </strong><a href="http://www.ddj.com"><strong>Dr. Dobb&#8217;s Journal</strong></a><strong> is permanently suspending print publication and<a href="http://www.ddj.com/linux-open-source/212700891"> going web-only</a></strong><strong>.</strong> Some of the content will be available as a new &#8220;Dr. Dobb&#8217;s Report&#8221; section of <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/">InformationWeek</a>. My Effective Concurrency column will continue, and I&#8217;ll continue to blog when new columns go live on the web, so if you&#8217;re reading the column via this blog nothing will significantly change for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of next month, the only major technical programmer&#8217;s trade magazines still available in print, that I know of, are platform- and technology-specific ones like <a href="http://www.aspnetpro.com/">asp.netPRO</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/default.aspx">MSDN Magazine</a> &#8212; and even those increasingly feature online-only content. For example, from MSDN Mag&#8217;s <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2009.01.editorsnote.aspx">January 2009 editor&#8217;s note</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we continue to grow our coverage to keep pace with the rapidly expanding set of technologies, we will often offer content exclusively online at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine">msdn.microsoft.com/magazine</a>. So please check in frequently!</p></blockquote>
<p>Gotta love RSS (and Atom etc.): Every text feed is like a magazine or newspaper column, every blogger a columnist. Every audio/video podcast feed is like a radio or TV series, or a radio station or TV channel. And our feed reader is the new magazine/newspaper, as we subscribe to columnists to make our personal custom newsmagazine. But RSS readers, along with RSS-consuming clients like iTunes, are more &#8212; they&#8217;re our personal selection, not only of the columns we want to read (on whatever topics we want, including the funnies section), but also of the media we want to hear and watch. It&#8217;s increasingly our way to choose the text, audio, and video we want all together. Who knew that a large chunk of the coming media convergence would come in the shape of RSS readers?</p>
<p>And other media are feeling the pressure from Dr. Web, the new gorilla:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This week (late December 2008), even cable operator Time Warner pushed web delivery for TV.</strong> Time Warner has had various contract disputes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/business/media/31cable.html?ref=media">with Viacom</a> and <a href="http://www.caller.com/news/2008/dec/31/time-warner-kiii-reach-agreement/">some local stations</a>. But as part of the dispute:
<ul>Time Warner will respond to Viacom’s advertisement, [Time Warner spokesman] Mr. Dudley said, by highlighting the availability of television content on the Internet.</p>
<p>“We will be telling our customers exactly where they can go to see these programs online,” Mr. Dudley said. “We’ll also be telling them how they can hook up their PCs to a television set.”</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>During October-December 2008, Netflix&#8217;s Watch Instantly has started to turn into a juggernaut.</strong> It&#8217;s interesting enough that you can watch 12,000+ movies and TV shows streamed over the net to your PC at high quality. As of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/26/netflix-finally-brings-watch-instantly-to-macs-via-silverlight/">October 2008, you can get them on your Mac</a>. As of <a href="http://gamerscoreblog.com/press/archive/2008/11/19/562420.aspx">November 2008, on your Xbox</a>. As of <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2008/12/tivo-dvrs-now-stream-movies-from.html">December 2008, on your TiVo</a>. As noted in one recent <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/12/24/BUR214QV6B.DTL">article</a>:
<ul>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good strategic move,&#8221; said Andy Hargreaves, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. &#8220;Netflix sees the world will go digital, no matter what they do. They realize there is more to be lost by waiting than doing it early.&#8221;</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And I won&#8217;t even get started on SaaS: hosted rich GUI apps served up on the web, for example the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSTRE4B75MP20081208">December 2008 (again) announcement about Office Online</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, don&#8217;t forget 2008, especially December 2008: The month the first major newspapers moved mostly to the web and abandoned print at least partly; the month that PC Magazine and Dr. Dobb&#8217;s suspended print publication and went web-only; the month Netflix Watch Instantly arrived in the living room on TiVos after hitting Xboxes a fortnight before; the month cable provider Time Warner threatened to tell people to watch TV on the net; and the month even Microsoft announced their intent to deliver significant Office web applications.</p>
<p>I for one welcome Dr. Web, our new Gorilla and media overlord!</p>
<p>Besides, what choice do I have?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even genuinely newsworthy topics can get distorted when commentators exaggerate or use data selectively. Here are two recent examples I noticed.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;This is the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.&#8221;</strong> It&#8217;s true that it&#8217;s bad and even historic, and this sound bite correctly doesn&#8217;t actually claim it&#8217;s as bad as the Depression. I hope it doesn&#8217;t turn out to be in the same league as that; then, people were lining up at soup kitchens. For now, however, Apple is still on track to sell 10 million iPhone 3Gs this year, which says something.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Yesterday [Monday, September 29, 2008] saw the worst single-day plunge in Dow Jones history.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s a new Black Monday.&#8221; </strong>Well, these got my attention, because I remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987)">Black Monday on October 19, 1987</a> very well. I was working in IT at a major bank, doing software application support for traders and related departments. When I went up to the trading floor that day, I immediately knew something was badly wrong because of the eerie sound as the elevator doors opened &#8212; a sound you never hear during trading hours, and certainly not from a room full of traders standing at their desks: silence.</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s loss of 777 points was stunning as the largest single-day point loss in Dow history. But as a <em>percentage</em> loss that&#8217;s not even in the top 10 Bad Dow Days, all but two of which occurred before 1935. Those two since the Depression occurred on October 19 and 26, 1987, when the Dow lost <strong>22.6%</strong> and then another <strong>8% </strong>of its total value in single sessions, respectively #2 and #9 on All-Time Bad Dow Days list. For perspective, as of this writing the Dow is down 19.8% so far this entire year, and it surely hasn&#8217;t been a good year. Today&#8217;s crisis is already historic and could well get worse yet, of course, but some of us do remember some pretty bad ones in the past.</p>
<p>As good old Sam Clemens said (approximately), there are lies, darned lies, and statistics. Even when the statistics are true, always cross-check them for perspective. Even the best news and the worst news can be overstated, and viewing the same data from multiple angles helps ensure we understand it properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Edited 9/30 to add: At 22.6%, Black Monday in 1987 was actually the worst Dow Day ever if you don&#8217;t count &#8220;reopening days&#8221; after unusual market closures when the markets catch up with events that happened while they were closed. So when was the all-time worst Dow Day ever? Perhaps surprisingly, the answer is not in 1929, though several of the all-time top 10 were in that year. Rather, it was December 12, 1914, when the Dow dropped 24.4% after the markets reopened after being closed entirely for over four months due to the outbreak of World War I. (The markets closed on July 30, two days after Austria-Hungary declared war and a day before Germany did.) That helps put in perspective just how bad October 1987 was, and of course that today&#8217;s crisis is also pretty bad even if it hasn&#8217;t beaten those prior records, yet.]</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.pcauthority.com.au/News/117291,computer-mouse-heading-for-extinction.aspx">This story</a> has been picked up semi-widely since last night. I&#8217;m sure this Steven Prentice they quote is a fine (Gartner) Fellow, but really:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The computer mouse is set to die out in the next five years and will be usurped by touch screens and facial recognition, analysts believe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seriously, does anyone who uses computers daily really believe this kind of prediction just because someone at Gartner says so? Dude, sanity check: 1. What functions do you use your mouse for? 2. How many of those functions can be done by pointing at your screen or smiling at the camera: a) at all; and b) with equivalent high precision and low arm fatigue? Of course the mouse, including direct equivalents like the touchpad/trackpad, will be replaced someday. But to notice that people like to turn and shake their Wii controllers and iPhones and then make the leap to conclude that this will replace mice outright in the short term seems pretty thin even for Gartner.</p>
<p>When you read a report from Gartner, Forrester, IDC and their brethren research firms, remember that you&#8217;re either getting real-world data (aka research) or a single analyst&#8217;s personal predictions (aka crystal-ball gazing). Research firms are good at what they&#8217;re good at, namely research:</p>
<ul>
<li>They&#8217;re &#8220;decent&#8221; at compiling current industry market data. Grade: A.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re &#8220;pretty okay&#8221; when they limit themselves to simple short-term extrapolation of that data, such as two-year projections of cost changes of high-speed networking in Canada or cell phone penetration in India. Grade: A-.</li>
</ul>
<p>But when they try bigger technology movement predictions like &#8220;X will replace Y in Z years&#8221; they average somewhere around &#8220;spotty,&#8221; and on their off days they dip down into &#8220;I think you forgot to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanity_test">sanity check</a> that sound bite&#8221; territory. It&#8217;s a pity that some venture capitalists take the research analysts&#8217; word as gospel. Reliability of technology shift predictions: D+.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago, I broke down and bought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle">Kindle</a>. I like it:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s a good and well-designed reader, and the experience is much better than the other e-book reading I&#8217;ve done before on phones and PDAs. I like how when you bookmark a page, you can see it&#8230; the corner of the page gets a little dog-ear. [1]</li>
<li>It&#8217;s got a nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper">e-paper</a> screen that uses ambient light, not backlight, which makes it readable anywhere just like a printed page &#8212; it&#8217;s even better, not worse, in direct sunlight.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s light and thin and sturdy. Sure beats carrying three or four books on a trip.</li>
<li>It has great battery life. I&#8217;ve only charged it once so far, when I first received it&#8230; since then I&#8217;ve had it for 11 days and read a full book and a half, and it still has 75% of its first charge left. (It helps that I turn the wireless off unless I&#8217;m actively using it.)</li>
<li>Fast, free wireless everywhere in the U.S., without computers or WiFi.</li>
</ul>
<p>But today, it transformed my reading experience.</p>
<p>This morning, I was unsuspectingly reading my feeds in Google Reader as usual, blissfully unaware that the way I read books was about to change. Among other articles, I noticed that Slashdot ran a <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/07/16/1330221">book review of <em>Inside Steve&#8217;s Brain</em></a> (that&#8217;s Jobs, not Wozniak or Ballmer). The review made me want to read the book. That&#8217;s when the new reality started, because I was interested in the book <em>now</em>, and had time to start reading it <em>now:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, I would have ordered it from Amazon and waited for it to arrive. But what usually happens then is that the book arrives a week later, and when it gets here I don&#8217;t have time to start it right away or I don&#8217;t quite feel like that kind of book just at the moment&#8230; and it goes on a shelf, with a 70% probability of being picked up at some point in the future.</li>
<li>Today, I searched for the book title on my Kindle, clicked &#8220;Buy&#8221;, and a few minutes later started reading <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Steves-Brain/dp/B0016H97LY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=digital-text&amp;qid=1216255732&amp;sr=1-1">Inside Steve&#8217;s Brain</a></em> while eating lunch. [2]</li>
</ul>
<p>That convenience isn&#8217;t merely instant gratification, it&#8217;s transformative. I suspect I&#8217;m going to be reading even more books now, even though I have a few little nits with the device, such as that the next and previous page buttons are a little too easy to press in some positions.</p>
<p>In other news, the Kindle also supports reading blogs and newspapers and some web surfing, but those are less compelling for me because I tend to do those things in the context of work, which means I&#8217;m already sitting at a computer with a bigger color screen and full keyboard. Maybe someday I&#8217;ll do it on e-paper. Until then, just living inside a virtual bookstore is plenty for me. Kindle + the Amazon Kindle store = iPod + iTunes for books. [3]</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/61186/2007/11/kindle.html">useful summary article</a> on Kindle features from a prospective user&#8217;s point of view.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>1. The first two books I downloaded? <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/0385267746">The Design of Everyday Things</a></em>, which was interestingly apropros to read on a new device like the Kindle with its nice dog-ear feedback and other well-designed features, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Foundation/dp/B000FC1PWA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=digital-text&amp;qid=1216255446&amp;sr=1-1"><em>Foundation</em></a>, which I hadn&#8217;t read in ages.</p>
<p>2. And it cost less than half what the dead-tree version would (though the latter was hardcover).</p>
<p>3. Caveat: I&#8217;m not actually an iPod owner, and I hate how Apple keeps insisting on installing iTunes on my computer just because I have Safari or QuickTime installed <span style="color:#808080;">(mutter grumble evil product-tying monopolies mutter grumble :-) )</span>. But apparently everyone else loves them, and they have indeed changed their industry.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Breathless celebrity &quot;news&quot; reporting isn&#8217;t enough&#8230; apparently we also need a direct invitation to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_media">trial by media</a>. From <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">McNews</a>: </p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://byfiles.storage.msn.com/y1pmEhyM4hSkGi8FBSukSJwm8yNlhAtCDr_k4n4qs8lGjudSm6S7Fxq1SiQP5MhSq_0pSwixthPCDM"><img style="border-width:0;" height="176" alt="image" src="http://byfiles.storage.msn.com/y1pmEhyM4hSkGgMPUepxeijk1GCjKjQt8B_-V3iolKFAVFZLIwhW7DKnsGKIeP8narWHX-AqNKEWus" width="289" border="0" /></a> </p>
<p>This is a perilous question in deceptively casual clothing. There should be nothing &quot;Quick&quot; about a question involving children&#8217;s lives. (Spears&#8217; name is immaterial &#8212; one could as well replace &quot;Britney Spears&quot; with &quot;Anyone&#8217;s Name,&quot; including yours or mine.) </p>
<p>It&#8217;s refreshing to see that McNews agrees we all have the right to enjoy a presumption of innocence. And that they would never encourage Joe Public to casually pass severe judgment on someone they don&#8217;t personally know, in absentia, based entirely on hearsay (especially hearsay reported by media with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias">selection bias</a> favoring sensational value), with a passing click of the mouse. </p>
<p>Removing children can be necessary, but it is a serious matter and so should be considered seriously through careful firsthand examination [*], not treated lightly as worthy of drive-by opinion-poll jurying. Perhaps I&#8217;m overly sensitive; I know of kids wrongly taken from their parents under outrageous pretexts, and the results can be tragic. </p>
<p>I understand the intent was just to throw out a quick question, and not to take it too seriously. That&#8217;s the problem. But then again, maybe making something profoundly important appear inconsequential is just playing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-side_and_B-side">B side</a> of celebrity &quot;news&quot; that tries to make the inconsequential appear profound. </p>
</p>
<p><strong>Footnotes</strong> </p>
<p>[*] Even with careful deliberation and due process, staggering mistakes can be and are made in serious matters. I&#8217;m currently reading John Grisham&#8217;s first nonfiction (and somewhat <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/polemic">polemic</a>) book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Innocent-Man-Murder-Injustice-Small/dp/0385517238"><em>The Innocent Man</em></a>, the tragic account of Ron Williamson, who was <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/burden/profiles/williamson.html">wrongly sentenced to death [PBS]</a> [**] for a murder he did not commit. According to Grisham&#8217;s account, Williamson was publicly hounded in a similar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_media">trial by media</a> in the local newspaper that influenced community (and juror pool) opinion for years before he was ever charged with anything in that crime. Disclaimer: Of course, Grisham&#8217;s book too is a media voice, and his account of the case is itself <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116043445277887423.html?mod=2_1167_1">charged with one-sided reporting</a>. Nobody seems to dispute that the conviction was unjust, however, though people do disagree on where to lay blame. </p>
<p>[**] No, I&#8217;m not expressing an opinion on the death penalty.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>According to McNews (<a href="http://www.cnn.com">this one</a> and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com">that one</a>) this must be Entitlement Week&#8230; two examples (emphasis mine):</div>
<div> </div>
<ul>
<li>A week ago: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/06/08/paris.hilton.ap/index.html">&quot;&#8217;It&#8217;s <strong>not right</strong>!&#8217; shouted the weeping Hilton.&quot;</a>
</li>
<li>Today, re the Sopranos finale:[*] <a href="http://blogs.usatoday.com/oped/2007/06/shows_blank_scr.html">&quot;&#8217;To go out like that was <strong>not right</strong>,&#8217;&quot;</a> a reader complained.</li>
</ul>
<div>Wow; there must be something in the water. How did we teach people to feel they are owed so many things, from serious things like license to break the law without consequences, to trivial things like a right to have someone else&#8217;s creation suit their whims?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Maybe we need an unreality check.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>[*] I&#8217;ve never watched The Sopranos and don&#8217;t know anything about the show. I watch TV only occasionally, and when I do I generally prefer fare like <a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dogwhisperer/">Dog Whisperer</a> and an occasional <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/jeopardy/indexflash.php">Jeopardy</a>.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, Slashdot is running an <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/03/07/2348254">article</a> on immigration. The discussion thread has some interesting notes (though, alas, the signal-to-noise seems to be noticeably lower than usual when reading at +5 &#8212; this seems to be quite a politically charged topic). </p>
<p>It reminds me of something that happened two years ago at the <a href="http://www.accu.org/index.php/conferences">ACCU conference</a>. I was on a panel that seemed innocuous enough, until one of the questions raised was immigration: &#8216;Is it a Good Thing or a Bad Thing that people come from other countries in order to do high-tech work here?&#8217; I&#8217;d been peripherally aware that this debate was going on in America, was interested to observe that it was also going on in the UK, and was quite surprised at what a hot button it had become. There sure was a lot of discussion with fervent opinions in both directions. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have an opinion either way on the issue, but I just thought I&#8217;d share an interesting (I hope) observation about perspective, as someone who is from Canada and now lives and works in the United States and thinks well of both places and the people in them: It&#8217;s interesting to me that in America (as in Canada), I have seen concerns like this about immigration and people coming from elsewhere to perform domestic professional jobs. I can understand the feelings behind those concerns. On the other hand, during the 35 years I lived in Canada I saw equally frequent and vocal concerns about emigration and the &quot;brain drain&quot; of professionals leaving Canada for the United States &#8212; notably doctors and high-tech folks, but we did lose a lot of actors too. And Bill Shatner. (Just kidding; I like Shatner.) </p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it interesting that when a skilled person moves, some people in the country they&#8217;re joining are worried that they&#8217;re arriving, and some people in the country that they&#8217;re leaving are equally worried that they&#8217;re going? </p>
<p>Just a thought. Back on Slashdot, though, my favorite comment was: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mr Gates did mention that 640K skilled immigrants ought to be enough for USA.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe till <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">January 18/19, 2038</a>. :-)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Hey, buddy, want a free laptop?&#8221; Assuming it was being offered by a legitimate store, and not from the back of a nondescript pickup truck parked behind the local mall, a lot of people would presumably say, &#8220;well, duh, sure!&#8221; Or would they?</p>
<p>A question that&#8217;s buzzing &#8217;round the blogosphere is whether it&#8217;s right for companies like AMD and Microsoft to give, and/or for bloggers to accept, such free-as-in-beer laptops with Vista installed. Presumably AMD hopes that the bloggers will like the hardware and write about it so that other people will hear how great it is and want AMD-based laptops too. Presumably Microsoft hopes that the bloggers will like Vista and write about it so that other people will hear how great it is and want Vista too.</p>
<p><a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Robert Scoble</a> thinks it&#8217;s <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2006/12/27/i-think-the-microsoft-vista-giveaway-is-an-awesome-idea/">&#8220;an awesome idea.&#8221;</a> On the flip side, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel Spolsky</a> thinks it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/12/28.html">&#8220;ethically indistinguishable from bribery&#8221;</a> and points out some interesting consequences. Me, I just love a chance to test the value of a potential principle derived from analyzing one situation by seeing how well it extends to similar situations. After all, if two questions X and Y are of the same kind, though perhaps different in degree, then an answer that&#8217;s true for X should also be true for Y. (If cannonballs fall downward when released, so should watermelons.)</p>
<p>So consider book publishers:</p>
<p>When a new book comes out, the publisher routinely mails out free copies to as many potential reviewers as they can possibly think of. Depending on the book, you could think of it as dead-tree spam. Anyone who writes for any moderately relevant media outlet that some potential book purchaser might read is a target liable to be deluged. Yes, publishers give those $50 books away for free, to the point where I&#8217;ve long ago had to ask publishers to PLEASE STOP SENDING ME BOOKS WITHOUT ASKING FIRST (er, sorry, that caps lock key gets jammed sometimes). You can find books in print <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/&amp;index=books&amp;field-author-exact=Scoble, Robert">by Scoble</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/&amp;index=books&amp;field-author-exact=Spolsky, Joel">by Spolsky</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/&amp;index=books&amp;field-author-exact=Sutter, Herb">by me</a> &#8212; and I&#8217;m sure all of our publishers routinely give away free copies of our new books to potential reviewers, hoping that making them available will increase the chances of getting a good review (as opposed to, say, no review at all if the potential reviewer misses the book entirely in the avalanche of new titles clamoring for their attention).</p>
<p>Sending free books to potential reviewers is a common practice. Readers seem to like it, because reading the buzz helps them to find out about new books that might interest them. On the other hand, if Spolsky is right, should we view &#8220;free books!&#8221; as an attempt to unfairly manipulate the buzz, an attempt which furthermore could cast a shadow of doubt on all reviews and reviewers, bloggers or otherwise?</p>
<p>So consider some variants of the question: Is it ethical for a vendor of</p>
<ul>
<li>books</li>
<li>software</li>
<li>hardware</li>
<li>any product</li>
</ul>
<p>to give away free products to potential reviewers, hoping to generate coverage?</p>
<p>Of course, the product costs vary; (most) laptops are more expensive than (most) books. But those are differences in degree, not differences in kind. If you think the price point matters, then what is the price boundary between &#8220;fair gift&#8221; and &#8220;bribery,&#8221; and why?</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t try to say what The Answer is; everyone needs to decide what their own answer will be, and act accordingly. I&#8217;m just observing that a consistent answer should apply well to all of these situations, including the &#8220;any product&#8221; general case.</p>
<p>What do you think, Robert and Joel?</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure and disclaimers</strong></p>
<p>Whereas the current tempest is about AMD-based machines for bloggers, I&#8217;m writing this on a free machine I was given (a) by a different vendor and (b) for a different reason. The machine I&#8217;m using now is an Intel quad-core machine that Intel gave me under the same &#8220;try it out, let us know what you think&#8221; conditions, because I&#8217;m a member of a Microsoft team whose software they presumably want to work well on Intel hardware. Both AMD and Intel routinely supply free machines for this purpose to various Microsoft teams. For the record, a few months ago AMD offered me a laptop just like the ones being talked about in the current tempest, but I turned it down because I already had an adequate laptop and had no use for another one.</p>
<p>Unlike the current tempest about machines given in hopes of garnering positive reviews, the machines supplied to internal Microsoft teams are presumably not given in hopes that we&#8217;ll blog about it (the vast majority of the recipients aren&#8217;t bloggers or other writers), but rather to make sure we develop and test our future software products on their hardware so that the software will be likely to work well on that hardware.</p>
<blockquote><p>Extra question for bonus points: Is it ethical for a {book|software|hardware|other} vendor to give away free products to potential value-add third parties, hoping to encourage add-ons that work well with their core product?</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m a Microsoft employee, but I don&#8217;t speak for Microsoft or even particularly care that it&#8217;s one of the names involved in the original question that I&#8217;m now generalizing. I&#8217;m interested in the question for its own sake, and I&#8217;m glad that Scoble and Joel have posted thoughtful comments on this topic.</p>
<p>P.S.: Like I said, Intel didn&#8217;t give me this machine because I&#8217;m a blogger. But since we&#8217;re already having this discussion, and because I am in fact a blogger, and I am at this very moment blogging, and I feel like saying that I do like this Intel quad-core machine, I&#8217;ll say so: I like it. Thanks, Intel. It&#8217;s a great, snappy machine. Oh, and its runs Vista just fine, and I like Vista too (well, except that Vista won&#8217;t run Civilization 4 well, but that&#8217;s another story&#8230;).</p>
