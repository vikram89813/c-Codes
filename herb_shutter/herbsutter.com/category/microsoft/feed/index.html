								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re at Build in San Francisco tomorrow afternoon, I invite you to swing by and spend an hour with us in session 2-661:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/2-661"><strong>Modern C++: What you need to know</strong></a><strong></p>
<p></strong>by Herb Sutter</p>
<p>Build 2014, Room 2005<br />2:30-3:30 pm, Thursday April 3, 2014
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re new to C++, this talk is aimed directly at you. I was asked to give a &#8220;foundational talk&#8221; about C++, and I decided that meant I should focus on addressing two questions that I get a lot these days:
</p>
<ul>
<li>FAQ #1 (1-2 slides): When should I use C++ compared to another language – on all platforms in general, and on Microsoft platforms in particular?
</li>
<li><strong>FAQ #2 (lots of slides): What should I know about C++ if I&#8217;m a {Java|C#|JavaScript|Python|…} developer?<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re a seasoned C++ developer, there are some nuggets and data points in the middle of the talk that I think you will find useful in your own work, and I hope that the talk as a whole will be helpful to you in providing a way to explain C++&#8217;s value proposition and give (or link to) an answer when someone asks <em>you</em> FAQ #2.
</p>
<p>I think it will be recorded, and will post a link here when the recording is available.
</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing many of you there tomorrow afternoon.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We just shipped Visual C++2013 last month, but I announced at GoingNative in September that there would be more soon: another CTP (compiler preview) containing another batch of C++11/14 features, sometime in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to report that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2013/11/18/announcing-the-visual-c-compiler-november-2013-ctp.aspx">today we shipped the promised CTP</a>. Compared to the &#8220;high probability in CTP&#8221; feature set I mentioned in my GoingNative talk, one of those features I mentioned didn&#8217;t quite make it (C++14 generalized lambda capture, a.k.a. move capture and more), but to compensate, both medium-probability features made it (C++14 generic lambdas and C++11 inheriting constructors) plus, as a bonus, also alignof and alignas which we didn&#8217;t think would make it for the CTP but did. Here&#8217;s the full set of new features, pasting from the announcement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implicit move special member function generation (thus also completing <em>=default</em>)</li>
<li>Reference qualifiers on member functions (a.k.a. &#8220;<em>&amp;</em> and <em>&amp;&amp;</em> for <em>*this</em>&#8220;)</li>
<li>Thread-safe function local static initialization (a.k.a. &#8220;magic statics&#8221;)</li>
<li>Inheriting constructors</li>
<li><em>alignof</em>/<em>alignas</em></li>
<li><em>__func__</em></li>
<li>Extended <em>sizeof</em></li>
<li><em>constexpr</em> (except for member functions)</li>
<li><em>noexcept</em> (unconditional)</li>
<li>C++14 <em>decltype(auto)</em></li>
<li>C++14 <em>auto</em> function return type deduction</li>
<li>C++14 generic lambdas (with explicit lambda capture list)</li>
<li>(Proposed for C++17) Resumable functions and <em>await</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The most-requested feature of C++14, and the one I&#8217;ve personally been anticipating the most, is generic lambdas &#8212; it is sweet to see it working right within Visual Studio 2013, as the CTP installs as a selectable toolset you can use within the shipping product to edit and build (no Intellisense or red squiggles though). Note that for this CTP, your lambda can be either generic (have an auto parameter type) or have a default capture list (e.g., [=] or [&amp;]), but not both &#8212; of course we&#8217;ll support both together in the future as the feature makes a future release.</p>
<p>As far as I know, this Visual C++ CTP is the first shipping (albeit CTP quality) C++ compiler to offer generic lambdas, though I expect Clang and gcc to also make them available soon &#8212; joy for C++ developers everywhere!</p>
<p>Once again, thank you very much again to the great Visual C++ team for producing this CTP; even as we speak, they&#8217;re hard at work on more. Thanks again also to the other members of the ISO C++ committee for producing a great and high-quality C++11 and soon-to-be-not-draft C++14.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy trying out this CTP.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of today&#8217;s VS 2013 launch, in addition to the live talks and Q&amp;A we also have some recently recorded talks that are now also live. My talk is a quick 20-minute tour of the new ISO C++ conformance features in VC++ 2013 &#8212; nothing I haven&#8217;t said before, so if you&#8217;ve seen my last two Build talks you&#8217;ve seen this material, only here I&#8217;ve condensed it to a distilled two-minute overview of each feature using examples.</p>
<p>Here they are, each between 4 and 20 minutes long. Note that these are just the (V)C++-specific topics &#8212; be sure to look at the Related Videos of each to see other new features that light up for C++ as well as for other languages.</p>
<h3><a href="http://events.visualstudio.com/eng/sessions/details?SessionProfile=1876&amp;TrackProfile=1864">ISO C++ Additions in Visual C++ 2013</a> (Herb Sutter)</h3>
<blockquote><p>ISO C++ received a major upgrade with the latest standard, adding many features that make the language both simpler and more powerful. Visual C++ 2010 and 2012 have already implemented a number of these features, from auto to range-for to lambdas.  In this video, Herb Sutter reviews the additional ISO C++ standards conformance improvements in Visual C++ 2013, and how each of them contributes to making modern C++ code clean, safe, and faster than ever.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://events.visualstudio.com/eng/sessions/details?SessionProfile=1873&amp;TrackProfile=1864">​What&#8217;s New for C++ Developers in Visual Studio 2013 IDE​</a> (Jennifer Leaf)</h3>
<blockquote><p>Visual Studio 2013 includes several compelling new features for C++ developers.  In this video, you’ll learn about IntelliSense improvements, the new code formatting feature, and other changes that help you navigate through and write your code.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://events.visualstudio.com/eng/sessions/details?SessionProfile=1891&amp;TrackProfile=1864">New Compiler Optimizations for C++ Applications</a> (Jim Hogg &amp; Ankit Asthana)</h3>
<blockquote><p>C++ developers will find many improvements in Visual Studio 2013 &#8212; including new versions of the compiler, linker and tools &#8212; that make code run faster.  In this video we&#8217;ll cover C++ performance improvements, including better vectorization; permutation in the order of loop nests; better Profile-Guided Optimization (that now applies to Windows Store apps); a new vector calling convention; and more support for C++ Accelerated Massive Parallelism (AMP).</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://events.visualstudio.com/eng/sessions/details?SessionProfile=1890&amp;TrackProfile=1864">Debugging Improvements for C++ Developers</a> (Brad Sullivan)</h3>
<blockquote><p>Visual Studio 2013 includes numerous improvements for debugging C++ applications.  In this video we&#8217;ll demo two of these features: Just My Code and JavaScript/Native Interop Debugging.</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://events.visualstudio.com/eng/sessions/details?SessionProfile=1836&amp;TrackProfile=1833">Introducing Visual Studio 2013 for Windows Developers Building C++ Apps</a> (Raman Sharma)</h3>
<blockquote><p>Visual C++ in Visual Studio 2013 includes improvements for Windows App developers in the core language and libraries, as well in tooling, debugging and designers.  This video will provide an overview of these new features in Visual Studio 2013 for C++ developers building Windows Store apps.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recap: Back in June, Microsoft:</p>
<ul>
<li>announced that were were moving to a faster cadence and shipped VS 2013 one year after VS 2012;</li>
<li>announced that new ISO C++ conformance features from the November 2012 CTP (and more) would be available in VS 2013, but not in VS 2012 Updates; and</li>
<li>didn&#8217;t announce pricing for VS 2013, so people who had just paid for VS 2012 Professional (only that specific SKU) were concerned that they might be charged full price again for VS 2013 Professional. (This applies to Professional only, because all other SKUs get free upgrades anyway &#8212; Express is always free, and Premium and Ultimate are subscription-based with free upgrades included in the subscription.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I just want to remind anyone who bought VS 2012 Professional that when the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/visual-studio-2013#pricing">actual pricing was announced last month</a>, it was announced that to ease the transition there would be a limited time promotional upgrade from VS 2012 Professional to VS 2013 Professional for $99, available from early November (now) until the end of January. You can wait until after the holidays to decide whether you want it, but I thought I&#8217;d just give another heads-up about the time limit if this upgrade matters to you.</p>
<p>I hope this is a good value, as VS 2013 has lots of new features for C++ users beyond just the additional ISO C++ conformance: lots of editor improvements from simple things like brace completion and parameter-sensitive Intellisense to the (IMO cool) enhanced scrollbar and peek definition; C++ AMP improvements; optimization improvements including a smarter auto-vectorizer; and much more. See <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2013/10/17/visual-studio-2013-available-now.aspx">this blog post for an overview</a> of what&#8217;s new in VC++ 2013 &#8212; the team did a lot in just one year, and thank you again to everyone who helped to make this happen!</p>
<p>What&#8217;s next for Visual C++:</p>
<ul>
<li>At Build and GoingNative, we announced that a preview CTP of the next batch of C++11/14 language features will be available this quarter. We&#8217;re still on track for that. Watch <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/">vcblog</a> and this space for the announcement.</li>
<li><strong>Tomorrow is the <a href="http://events.visualstudio.com/">VS 2013 virtual launch</a>.</strong> Given that we already shipped the product itself a month ago so that you already have it in your hands, is there any reason to watch the launch? Short answer: Yes, I think you&#8217;ll find it interesting and worth your while.</li>
</ul>

<p>This has been a phenomenal year for C++, since C++11’s publication just 12 months ago. And yesterday was a great day for C++.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had the privilege of announcing much of what Microsoft and the industry have been working on over the past year.</p>
<h2>(minor) C++ at Microsoft</h2>
<p>On September 12, we shipped VC++ 2012 with the complete C++11 standard library, and adding support for C++11 range-<em>for</em>, <em>enum class</em>, <em>override </em>and <em>final</em>. Less than two months later, yesterday we announced and shipped the November 2012 CTP, a compiler add-in to VC++ 2012 adding C++11 variadic templates, uniform initialization and <em>initializer_list</em>s, delegating constructors, function template default arguments, explicit conversion operators, and raw string literals. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2012/11/02/visual-c-c-11-and-the-future-of-c.aspx"><strong>Details here</strong></a>, and <a href="http://aka.ms/vc-ctp"><strong>download here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Note that this is just the first batch of additional C++11 features. Expect further announcements and deliveries in the first half of 2013.</p>
<h2>(major) C++ across the industry</h2>
<p>Interest and investment in C++ continues to accelerate across the software world.</p>
<ul>
<li>ISO C++ standardization is <strong><a href="http://isocpp.org/std/status">accelerating</a></strong>. Major companies are dedicating more people and resources to C++ standardization than they have in years. Over the next 24 months, we plan to ship three Technical Specifications and a new C++ International Standard.</li>
<li>C++ now has a home on the web at <a href="http://isocpp.org"><strong>isocpp.org</strong></a>. Launched yesterday, it both aggregates the best C++ content and hosts new content itself, including Bjarne Stroustrup’s new <a href="http://isocpp.org/tour">Tour of C++</a> and Scott Meyers’ new <a href="http://isocpp.org/blog/2012/11/universal-references-in-c11-scott-meyers">Universal References article</a>.</li>
<li>We now have a <a href="http://isocpp.org/about"><strong>Standard C++ Foundation</strong></a>. Announced yesterday, it is already funded by the largest companies in the industry down to startups, financial institutions to universities, book publishers to other consortia, with more members joining weekly. For the first time in C++’s history since AT&amp;T relinquished control of the language, we have an entity – a trade organization – that exists exclusively to promote Standard C++ on all compilers and platforms, and companies are funding it because the world runs on C++, and investing in Standard C++ is good business.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/11/03/our-industry-is-young-again-and-its-all-about-ui/">This is an exciting time to be part of our industry</a>, on any OS and using any language. It’s especially an exciting time to be involved with C++ on all compilers and platforms.</p>
<p>Thank you all, whatever platform and language you use, for being part of it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The three by-far-most-requested “missing features” from Visual C++ 2012 were:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Conformance:</strong> Keep adding more C++11 language conformance features.</li>
<li><strong>XP Targeting:</strong> Deliver the ability to build applications that could run on Windows XP, as well as Windows Vista, 7, and 8.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Express:</strong> Deliver a free VC++ Express compiler that can be used to create traditional Windows desktop apps, not just Windows Store apps.</li>
</ol>
<p>Over the spring and summer, we promised to address these “soon after VC++ 2012 ships.”</p>
<p>Well, VC++ 2012 shipped four weeks ago.</p>
<p>What’s happened since then?</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">3. </font></strong>On the same day VS2012 shipped, four weeks ago, we also <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/09/12/vc-2012-desktop-expres-free/">announced and released Visual Studio 2012 <strong>Desktop Express</strong></a> – a free Visual Studio version for writing traditional Windows applications.</p>

<p>Casablanca gives you the power to use existing native C++ libraries and code to do awesome things on the cloud server. In this talk from TechEd Australia, <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Australia/2012/AZR331">John Azariah and Mahesh Krishnan show how it’s done</a>.</p>

Besides additional C++11 standards conformance with range-for, override and final on the language side (with more to come in the coming months; watch this space) and a complete C++11 standard library implementation, the free compiler also includes unit testing framework for C++, code analysis for C++ (try /analyze today if you haven’t already, <a href="http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2011/12/24/static-code-analysis/">as John Carmack says so well</a>), C++ AMP for GPGPU programming, and much more.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Visual C++ team is looking for a number of people to do great work on C++11, parallelizing/vectorizing, cloud, libraries, and more. All I can say is that there’s a lot of cool stuff in the pipeline that directly addresses real needs, including things people regularly comment about on this blog that I can’t answer specifically yet but will soon.</p>
<p>If you might like to be part of it, here’s how – 13 positions right now and more to come as we update this list:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2012/06/01/10313804.aspx">Be What’s Next (We’re hiring!)</a></strong></p>
<p>The C++ organization is growing and hiring across all feature areas (C++ 11, compiler front-end, compiler back-end, C++ AMP, PPL, libraries &amp; runtime, IDE, Casablanca). We are looking for passionate program managers, developers and testers to bang out the next versions of the toolset!</p>
<p>What’s in it for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Be part of the C++ standards evolution &#8211; you’ll have the opportunity to work side-by-side with folks like Herb Sutter </p>
</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to know how to write cool tablet apps using Visual C++?</p>
<p>On May 18, Microsoft is hosting a <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Announcing-Building-Windows-8-Metro-Style-Apps-with-C-A-Free-Event">one-day free technical event for developers who want to write Metro apps for Windows 8 using Visual C++</a>. I’m giving the opening talk, and the rest of the day is full of useful technical information on everything from XAML and DirectX to networking and VC++ compiler flags.</p>
<p>Please note: This event is Windows-specific, and talks will use both portable ISO C++ as well as Visual C++-specific libraries and compiler extensions; for brevity these are being referred to as &quot;C++&quot; to highlight to a Microsoft-specific audience that that this day is about Visual C++, not about Visual C# or Visual Basic or JavaScript.</p>
<p>From the page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Join the Microsoft Visual C++ and Windows teams in Redmond on May 18, 2012 for a free, all-day event focused on building Windows 8 Metro style apps with C++.&#160; </p>
<p>These Windows-specific talks will use both portable ISO C++ and Visual C++-specific compiler extensions; for brevity below we&#8217;ll refer to both as &quot;C++&quot; (i.e., this day is about Visual C++, not Visual C# or JavaScript).</p>
<p>We will have pragmatic advice for every developer writing Metro style apps and games with XAML and/or DirectX and C++.</p>
<p><a href="https://win8.msregistration.com/default.aspx?ID=559a9ac4-96a6-46a1-b359-598e345d25be"><strong>Register now!</strong></a></p>
<p>Agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual C++ for Windows 8, Keynote by Herb Sutter</li>
<li>Building Windows 8 apps with XAML and C++</li>
<li>Building Windows 8 games with DirectX and C++</li>
<li>Introduction to the Windows Runtime Library&#160; (WRL)</li>
<li>Writing Connected apps: Writing networking code with C++</li>
<li>Combining XAML &amp; DirectX in a Metro style apps</li>
<li>Writing WinRT components to be consumed from any language</li>
<li>VC11 compiler flags for getting the most out of C++</li>
</ul>
<p>All sessions will be recorded and available for on demand viewing on C9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wish I’d blogged about it right away when it was announced a week or so ago, because registration filled immediately before I could blog it (I think on the first day), and then when the room was expanded it filled again right away again before I could blog about it. Then I procrastinated for a few days. You can still <a href="https://win8.msregistration.com/default.aspx?ID=559a9ac4-96a6-46a1-b359-598e345d25be">register here for the waitlist</a> to see it in person, but I have good news…</p>
<p><strong>All sessions will be broadcast livestream and then available for viewing on demand.</strong> If you’re halfway around the world, or just halfway across the country, it’s hard to fly somewhere for a one-day event anyway; thanks to livestream and on-demand, the Internet is our friend. I look forward to seeing and e-seeing many of you there.</p>

The goal is to find or develop modern C++ libraries that leverage C++11 features, and then submit the best for standardization.</p>
<p>Microsoft wants to do its part, and here’s a step in that direction.</p>
<p>Today I’m pleased to see Soma’s post about <strong><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2012/04/30/devlabs-c-cloud-services-and-you.aspx">“C++, Cloud Services, and You”</a></strong> announcing the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/casablanca"><strong>DevLabs release of Casablanca</strong></a>, a set of C++ libraries for Visual C++ users that start to bring the same modern conveniences already enjoyed by .NET and Node.js and Erlang users also to C++ developers on our local and cloud platforms, including modern C++ libraries for REST, HTTP, and JSON. From Soma’s announcement, adding my own <strong>emphasis </strong>and minor code edits:</p>
<blockquote><p>Historically, we’ve lacked such simple tools for developers using C++.  While there are multiple relevant native networking APIs (e.g. WinINet, WinHTTP, IXMLHttpRequest2, HTTP Server API), these are not optimized from a productivity perspective for <strong>consuming and implementing RESTful cloud services using modern C++</strong>.  They don’t compose particularly well with code based on the standard C++ libraries, and they don’t <strong>take advantage of modern C++ language features and practices</strong> in their programming models.</p>
<p>This is where “Casablanca” comes in.  “Casablanca” is a set of libraries for C++ developers, taking advantage of some recent standard language features already available through Visual Studio.</p>
<p><strong>“Casablanca” aims to make it significantly easier for C++ coders to consume and implement RESTful services.  It builds on lessons from .NET, from Node.js, from Erlang, and from other influencers to create a modern model that is meant to be easy to program while still being scalable, composable, and flexible.</strong></p>
<p>As an example, here’s a snippet that uses the client HTTP library to search Bing for my name and output the results to the console:</p>
<pre>    http_client bing( L"http://www.bing.com/search" );

    bing.request( methods::GET, L"?q=S.Somasegar" )
        .then( []( http_response response ) {
            cout &lt;&lt; "HTML SOURCE:" &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; response.to_string() &lt;&lt; endl; })
        .wait();</pre>
<p>and here’s a simple web listener hosted in a console application:</p>
<pre>    listener::create( argv[1], []( http_request req ) {
            req.reply( status_codes::OK, "Namaste!" ); })
        .listen( []{ fgetc( stdin ); } )
        .wait();</pre>
<p>For those of you looking to build Azure services in C++, “Casablanca” comes with a Visual Studio wizard to set up everything up correctly.  You can target both Web and Worker roles, and you can access Azure storage using the built-in C++ library bindings. […] Taking C++ to the cloud with “Casablanca” is another exciting step in that journey.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today’s Casablanca release is as a DevLabs project, to get usability feedback and to eventually support these features in the full Visual C++ product. If you’re interested in using C++ to consume and implement cloud services, and sharing what kind of support you want and whether you think Casablanca is on the right track, please let us know in the <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/casablanca/threads">forums</a>.</p>
<p>Looking beyond Visual C++, one piece of Casablanca is already being proposed for standardization, namely the “future.then” nonblocking continuations that are required to be able to write highly responsive composable libraries – you really want all async libraries to talk about their work using the same type, and std::future already gives half of what we need (blocking synchronization) and just needs the non-blocking part too. Also being proposed as an optional layer on top of “future.then” is an “await” style of language support to make the async operations as easy to express and use in C++ as in any of the best languages in the world.</p>
<p>Note that there are other C++ libraries too for several of these facilities. Repeating what I said at GoingNative, we (Microsoft) don’t care whose libraries get standardized – whether ones we contribute or someone else’s. We care most that <em>there be</em> standard C++ libraries for these modern uses, starting with the most basic “future.then” support, and to encourage all companies and groups who have libraries in these important spaces to contribute them and take the best and make them available to C++ developers on all platforms. This is a small step in that process.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2012/04/24/reader-qa-flash-redux/">answering</a> a reader question about Flash today, I linked to <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/flash-focus.html">Adobe’s November press release</a> and I commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Granted, Adobe says it’s abandoning Flash ‘only for new mobile device browsers while still supporting it for PC browsers.’ This is still a painful statement because [in part] … the distinction between mobile devices and PCs is quickly disappearing as of this year as PCs are becoming fully mobilized.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what’s a “mobile device” vs. a “PC” as of 2012? Here’s a current data point, at least for me.</p>
<p>For almost two weeks now, my current primary machine has been a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/windowspreview/">Slate 7 running Windows 8 Consumer Preview</a>, and I’m extremely pleased with it. It’s a full Windows notebook (sans keyboard), and a full modern tablet. How do I slot it between “mobile device” and “PC,” exactly? Oh, and the desktop browser still supports Flash, but the tablet style browser doesn’t…</p>
<p>Since I’ve been using it (and am using it to write this post), let me write a mini-review.</p>
<p>I loved my iPad, and still do, and so I was surprised how quickly I came to love this snappy device even more. Here are a few thoughts, in rough order from least to most important:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a few nice touches that I miss on iOS, like task switching by simple swipe-from-left (much easier than double-clicking the home button and swiping, and my iPhone home button is started to get unreliable with all the double-clicking <em>[ETA: and I never got used to four-finger swiping probably in part because it isn&#8217;t useful on the iPhone]</em>), having a second app open as a sidebar (which greatly relieves the aforementioned back-and-forth task-switching I find myself doing on iOS to refer to two apps), and some little things like including left- and right-cursor keys on the on-screen keyboard (compared to iOS’s touch-and-hold to position the cursor by finger using the magnification loupe). In general, the on-screen keyboard is not only unspeakably better than Win7’s attempt, but even slightly nicer than iPad’s as I find myself not having to switch keyboards as much to get at common punctuation symbols.</li>
<li>I was happily surprised to find that some of my key web-related apps like Live Writer came already installed.</li>
<li>The App Store, which isn’t even live yet, already had many of my major apps including Kindle, USA Today, and Cut the Rope. Most seem very reliable; a few marked “App Preview” are definitely beta quality at the moment though. The Kindle app is solid and has everything I expected, except for one complaint: It should really go to a two-column layout in landscape mode like it does on iPad, especially given the wider screen. Still, the non-“preview” apps do work, and the experience and content is surprisingly nice for a not-officially-open App Store.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/mobile-news/windows-8-tablets-secret-weapon-onenote-and-inking/6285">Real pen+ink support.</a> This is a Big Deal, <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2010/04/01/links-i-enjoyed-reading-this-week-3/">as I said two years ago</a>. Yes, I’ve tried several iPad pens and apps for sort-of-writing notes, and no, iOS has nothing comparable here; the best I can say for the very best of them is that they’re like using crayons. Be sure to try real “ink” before claiming otherwise – if you haven’t, you don’t know what you’re missing. iPad does have other good non-pen annotation apps, and I’ve enjoyed using <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iannotate-pdf/id363998953?mt=8">iAnnotate PDF</a> extensively to read and annotate almost half of <a href="http://erdani.com/index.php/books/tdpl/">Andrei’s D book</a>. But for reading articles and papers I just really, really miss pen+ink.</li>
<li>All my software just works, from compilers and editors to desktop apps for full Office and other work.</li>
<li>Therefore, finally, I get my desktop environment and my modern tablet environment <strong>without carrying two devices</strong>. My entire environment, from apps to files, is always there without syncing between notebook and tablet devices, and I can finally eliminate a device. I expected I would do that this year, but I’m pleasantly surprised to be able to do it for real already this early in the year with a beta OS and beta app store.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t expect to switch over to it this quickly, but within a few days of getting it I just easily switched to reading my current book-in-progress on this device while traveling (thanks to the Kindle app), reading and pen-annotating a couple of research papers on lock-free coding techniques (it’s by far my favorite OneNote device ever thanks to having both great touch and great pen+ink and light weight so I can just <em>write</em>), and using it both as a notebook and as a tablet without having to switch devices (just docking when I’m at my desk and using the usual large monitors and <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB110LL/B">my favorite keyboard</a>+mouse, or holding it and using touch+pen only). It already feels like a dream and very familiar both ways. I’m pretty sure I’ll never go back to a traditional clamshell notebook, ever.</p>
<p>Interestingly, as a side benefit, even the desktop apps are often very, and more, usable when in pure tablet+touch mode than before despite the apparently-small targets. Those small targets do sometimes matter, and I occasionally reach for my pen when using those on my lap. But I’ve found in practice they often don’t matter at all when you swipe to scroll a large region – I was surprised to find myself happily using Outlook in touch-only mode. In particular, it’s my favorite OneNote device ever.</p>
<p>By the end of this week when I install a couple of more apps, including the rest of my test C++ compilers, <strong>it will have fully replaced my previous notebook and my previous tablet, with roughly equal price and power as the former alone (4GB RAM, 128GB SSD + Micro SD slot, Intel Core i5-2467M) and roughly equal weight and touch friendliness as the latter alone (1.98lb vs. 1.44lb).</strong> Dear Windows team, my back thanks you.</p>
<p>So, then, returning to the point – in our very near future, how much sense does it really make to <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/flash-focus.html">distinguish between browsers for “mobile devices” and “PCs,”</a> anyway? Convergence is already upon us and is only accelerating.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Braun asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>@Tom @Herb: What’s so wrong with flash that it should be boycotted? Have I been being abused by it in some way I’m not aware of? Also,does HTML5 have any bearing on the subject?</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not saying it should be boycotted, only that I avoid it. Here&#8217;s what I wrote two years ago: <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2010/03/30/flash-in-the-pan/">“Flash In the Pan”</a>.  Besides security issues and crashing a lot, Flash is a headache for servicing and seems to be architecturally unsuited for lower-power environments.</p>
<p>Since then, two more major developments:</p>
<h3>1. Even Adobe has given ground (if not given up).</h3>
<p>Adobe subsequently <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/flash-focus.html">abandoned Flash for mobile browsers</a> and started shipping <a href="http://html.adobe.com/">straight-to-HTML5 tools</a>.</p>
<p>Granted, Adobe says it’s abandoning Flash ‘only for new mobile device browsers while still supporting it for PC browsers.’ This is still a painful statement because:</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s obvious that ceding such <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/networking/flash-is-dead-long-live-html5/1633">high-profile</a> and <a href="http://www.imore.com/2010/04/29/adobe-ceo-responds-steve-jobs-open-letter/">hard-fought</a> ground sends a message about overall direction; and</li>
<li>the distinction between mobile devices and PCs is quickly disappearing as of this year as PCs are becoming fully mobilized (more on this in my next blog post).</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. We’re moving toward plugin-avoiding browsing.</h3>
<p>Browsers are increasingly moving to reduce plugins, or eliminate them outright, for security/reliability/servicing reasons. Moving in that direction crease pressure or necessity to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>ban Flash (Mobile Safari, and <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20105870-264/microsoft-joins-the-anti-flash-crowd-with-ie10/">Metro style Internet Explorer 10</a>); or</li>
<li>deliver Flash built into the browser itself (even for plugin-allowing browsers <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=108086">like Chrome</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not saying Flash will die off immediately or necessarily even die off entirely at all; there’s a lot of inertia, it’s still useful in many kinds of devices, and it may well hang on for some time. But its architectural problems and current trajectory are fairly clear, and it’s been months since I’ve heard someone complain that certain people were just <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">being unfair</a> – Jobs’ technical points are on the right side of history.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2012/Language-Support-for-Asynchronous-Programming">nice talk by Mads Torgersen just went live on Channel 9</a> about C#’s non-blocking <em>Task&lt;T&gt;.ContinueWith()</em> library feature and <em>await</em> language feature, which are a big hit in C# (and Visual Basic) for writing highly concurrent code that looks pretty much just like sequential code. Mads is one of the designers of <em>await</em>.</p>
<p>If you’re a C++ programmer, you may be interested in this because I’ve worked to have these very features be offered as proposals for ISO C++, just with a few naming tweaks like renaming <em>Task&lt;T&gt;.ContinueWith()</em> to <em>std::future&lt;T&gt;::then()</em>. They were initially presented at the recent Kona meeting in February, and we’ll dig deeper next month at the special ISO C++ study group meeting on concurrency and parallelism.</p>
<p>Here’s the talk link and abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2012/Language-Support-for-Asynchronous-Programming">Language Support for Asynchronous Programming</a></h3>
<p><strong>Mads Torgersen</strong></p>
<p>Asynchronous programming is what the doctor usually orders for unresponsive client apps and for services with thread-scaling issues. This usually means a bleak departure from the imperative programming constructs we know and love into a spaghetti hell of callbacks and signups. C# and VB are putting an end to that, reinstating all your tried-and-true control structures on top of a future-based model of asynchrony.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While we were chatting after the talk, I managed to gently twist Mads’ arm and he has graciously agreed to come to the May 7-9 ISO C++ parallelism study group special meeting to present this to the committee members in detail and answer questions about <em>await</em>’s design and C# users’ experience with it in production code, which will help the committee decide whether or not this is something they want to pursue for ISO C++.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the talk. While at Lang.NEXT, I also participated in a panel and gave a C++ talk but those sessions aren’t live yet; I’ll post links once they are.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Trivia:</strong> If you noticed the Romanian accent in the first question from the audience, it’s because it came from Andrei Alexandrescu, who was sitting beside Walter Bright, both of whom were two of the other speakers at the conference. It was fun to be in a room full of language designers and implementers sharing notes about each other’s languages and experience.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, I announced in my GoingNative talk <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/GoingNative-2012/C-11-VC-11-and-Beyond">C++11, VC++11 and Beyond</a> that Visual C++ 11 Beta would be available in February.</p>
<p>Today’s the day: <strong>You can </strong><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=240160"><strong>download Visual Studio 11 Beta here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Interestingly, VC++11 is being distributed under a <strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us/downloads/go-live">go-live license</a></strong>, which means that Microsoft supports using this compiler to write production code. That’s unusual for a first beta, and it means you can start using its features – notably parallelism and C++11 library and language conformance improvements like range-based for loops – in your production code right away.</p>
<p>We had already announced that VC++11 <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh409293(v=vs.110).aspx">includes quite a bit of stuff</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2012/02/29/10272778.aspx">here’s what’s new in the beta</a>. Some highlights of the whole product:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete ISO C++11 standard library.</strong> As announced in September, we’ve added full support for essentially the entire C++11 standard library, which I think is a first for the industry to ship in-the-box with a C++ compiler product. We already shipped most of the C++11 stdlib in VC++ 2010, and now we’re including <strong>threads, mutexes, condition variables, atomics, futures, and async</strong> – and not just as checkmark features, but with async and futures built on top of our ConcRT runtime that also powers the Parallel Patterns Library. Oh, and we’re also shipping an implementation of the draft-standard header <strong>&lt;filesystem&gt;</strong> based on Boost.filesystem for portable access to directories and files. (The ISO C++ committee has just resumed work on filesystem for near-term standardization; more about this soon in my ISO C++ trip report, which I plan to post within a few days.)</li>
<li><strong>Several more ISO C++11 language features.</strong> As mentioned in September, we’ve added support for C++11 <strong>stateless lambdas</strong> and <strong>scoped enumerations</strong>. On top of that, we were happy to announce this month that we’re also adding the <strong>range-based for loop, override, and final</strong> – all of which are available in today’s release, and supported for production code. </li>
<li><strong>Parallelism galore. </strong>As we <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2011/06/15/introducing-amp.aspx">announced</a> in June, it includes <strong>C++ AMP </strong>for parallel programming on CPUs and GPUs (with a view to more in the future, including cloud). This month we were also able to add that if the end user’s machine doesn’t have a compute-class GPU and is running Windows 8, we also provide an automatic fallback to multicore + vector SSE instructions, which for now is a fallback but we will continue to improve, so it’s already not just about GPUs. We’ve also <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nativeconcurrency/archive/2012/02/28/ppl-and-concrt-what-s-new-in-visual-studio-11-beta.aspx">expanded the <strong>Parallel Patterns Library (PPL)</strong></a> to support Standard C++11 concurrency features, provide more STL-style concurrent containers (e.g., concurrent_unordered_map), more parallel STL-style algorithms (e.g., parallel_sort), and a block-free continuation library for async operations (think “future.then()”, but for now we named it “task.then()” in case ISO C++ wants to surface something like this differently). Almost lost in all the news was another cool nugget: We’re also shipping an <strong>automatic vectorizing and parallelizing compiler</strong> that takes loops (with optional hints) and automatically generates both multi-core parallel and SSE-style vector code for you. </li>
<li><a href="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/image17.png"><img style="display:inline;float:right;margin:10px 0 10px 10px;" title="image" alt="image" align="right" src="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/image_thumb2.png?w=355&#038;h=194" width="355" height="194" /></a><strong>Windows 8 support, including Metro-style tablet apps on x86 and ARM.</strong> A major engineering change like Windows 8 comes along about once a decade, so with <strong>C++/CX</strong> and <strong>WRL</strong> we did a huge amount of work to ensure that VC++ gets great compiler and tool support for writing Windows 8 apps, while writing the minimum quantity of non-ISO standard code on the boundaries with the Windows environment (usually just ^ and ref new, similar to C++/CLI; the vast majority of your code should remain portable C++). And we wanted to make sure that VC++ is a first-class language that is visibly clean, safe, and fast – just as clean and safe in side-by-side code examples with Javascript and .NET CLR (e.g., you can write a XAML UI equally easily on top of any of these language projections), and with C++’s traditional power and performance (e.g., VC++ also supports creating tablet DirectX games and other graphics-intensive apps). Oh, and we brought up a whole new processor architecture: ARM.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I also mentioned in this month’s talk, once VC++11 ships, we’re switching to a faster out-of-band release cadence so that we can deliver features more quickly than waiting for Visual Studio release schedules – especially to continue to roll out C++11 language features in batches, on a path to full conformance as soon as possible. The first thing you’ll see is a Community Tech Preview (CTP) that we intend to ship soon after VC++11 ships, which we expect to take the form of a new command-line compiler (initially not IDE integration and Intellisense) that you an drop into VC++11 to quickly start taking advantage of still more of the new C++11 language features, with a full out-of-band release to follow after that with still more.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, <a href="https://illumeweb.smdisp.net/collector/Survey.ashx?Name=mscpp11"><strong>please take this quick C++11 feature survey</strong></a> where you can vote on what C++11 features are most urgent for you in VC++. We’re going to implement all C++11 features, but we have to do them in some order – we’re users too and talk to customers regularly, so we think we know what’s most urgent, but we want to sanity-check that with you and make sure we’re doing them in the right order to deliver the most benefit to the most people as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>My two talks from last week&#8217;s <a href="http://buildwindows.com">//build/</a> conference are online.</p>
<p>My personal favorite is <strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/TOOL-835T">Writing Modern C++ Code: How C++ Has Evolved Over the Years</a></strong>. The thesis is simple: Modern ISO Standard C++ code is clean, safe, and fast. C++ has got a bad rap over the years, partly earned, but that&#8217;s history. This talk is a &#8220;welcome to modern C++&#8221; for programmers who may never have seen C++ before, or are familiar only with older and more difficult C++.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re already a modern C++ developer you may be thinking, &#8220;but I do most of those things already, why is there a whole talk on this at a Microsoft conference?&#8221; Because as interest and use of Standard C++ is heating up again, it&#8217;s important to ensure that people have a good experience as they return to C++, or turn to it for the first time. Thus we sometimes have called this the &#8220;happy path&#8221; talk &#8212; designed to show the simple happy path through modern C++ that avoids needless pitfalls.</p>
<p>My other talk was <strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/TOOL-532T">Using the Windows Runtime From C++</a></strong>. This is Windows 8-specific and talks about the &#8220;foreign object model&#8221; language extensions used by Visual C++ 11 to talk to the new native ABI-safe WinRT types. These extensions should be used sparingly, only on the thin module boundaries around otherwise nice and portable Standard C++ code, and it was necessary to add them only because Standard C++ types aren&#8217;t ABI-safe and accessible safely from other languages. (If ISO C++ were to get a module system at some point that includes being able to talk about ABI-safe types on module boundaries, that would be happiness indeed!) There is also a template library called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh309536%28VS.85%29.aspx">Windows Runtime C++ Template Library (WRL)</a> that is another way to access basically the same functionality using template syntax; pick whichever you like best.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who attended!</p>

<p>Channel 9 has just posted a recording of my intro talk at <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com">C++ and Beyond 2011</a> last month in Banff. Here&#8217;s the link: <strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/C-and-Beyond-2011-Herb-Sutter-Why-C" target="_blank">C++ and Beyond 2011: Why C++</a>.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a keynote-y talk, not a technical talk, but we felt it was important to address an important trend involving the language. The goal is to share a perspective and rationale for why of late there&#8217;s such a resurgence of interest in C++ &#8212; both across the industry, and within Microsoft.</p>
<p>Whether or not you agree with the perspective and rationale, I hope you enjoy it!</p>

It&#8217;s called <strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/C9-GoingNative">&#8220;Going Native&#8221;</a></strong>&#8230; iTunes podcast <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/c9-goingnative-hd-channel-9/id453292594">here</a>, Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/C9GoingNative">@C9GoingNative</a>.</p>
<p>From the description:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>C9::GoingNative</strong> is a show dedicated to native development with an emphasis on C++ and C++ developers. Each episode will have a segment including an interview with a native dev in his/her native habitat (office) where we&#8217;ll talk about what they do and how they use native code and associated toolchains, as well as get their insights and wisdom—geek out. There will be a small news component or segment, but the show will primarily focus on technical tips and conversations with active C/C++ coders, demonstrations of new core language features, libraries, compilers, toolchains, etc.</p>
<p>We will bring in guests from around the industry for conversations, tutorials, and demos. As we<br />
progress, we will also have segments on other native languages (C, D, Go, etc&#8230;). It&#8217;s all native all the time.</p>
<p>You, our viewers, fly first class. We&#8217;ll deliver what <strong>you</strong> want to see. That&#8217;s how it works.</p>
<p>Go native!</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I had the privilege of talking about some of the work we&#8217;ve been doing to support massive parallelism on GPUs in the next version of Visual C++. The video of my talk announcing C++ AMP <strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/AFDS-Keynote-Herb-Sutter-Heterogeneous-Computing-and-C-AMP">is now available on Channel 9</a></strong>. (Update: Here&#8217;s an <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/AMD-Fusion-Developer-Summit/AMD-Fusion-Developer-Summit-11/KEYNOTE">alternate link</a>; it seems to be posted twice.)</p>
<p>The first 20 minutes has nothing to do with C++ in particular or any platform in particular, but tries to make the case that the right way to view the &#8220;trends&#8221; of multicore computing, GPU computing, and cloud computing (HaaS) is that they are not three trends at all, but merely facets of the same single trend &#8212; heterogeneous parallel computing.</p>
<p>If they are, then one programming model should be able to address them all. We think we&#8217;ve found one.</p>
<p>The main reasons we decided to build a new model is that we believe there needs to be a single model that has all of the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>C++, not C:</strong> It should leverage C++&#8217;s power for strong abstraction without sacrificing performance, not just be a dialect of C.</li>
<li><strong>Mainstream:</strong> It should be programmable by millions of developers, not just by a priesthood. Litmus test: Is the Hello World parallel GPU program a page and half, or a couple of lines?</li>
<li><strong>Minimal:</strong> It adds just one general-purpose language extension that addresses not only the immediate problem (dealing with cores that can&#8217;t support full C++) but many others. With the right general-purpose extension, the rest can be done as just a library.</li>
<li><strong>Portable:</strong> It allows shipping a single EXE that can use any combination of GPU vendors&#8217; hardware. The initial implementation uses DirectCompute and supports all devices that are DX11 capable; DirectCompute is just an implementation detail of the first release, and the model can (and I expect will) be implemented to directly talk to any interesting hardware.</li>
<li><strong>General and future-proof:</strong> The initial release will focus on GPU computing, but it&#8217;s intended to enable people to write code for the GPU in a way that in the future we can recompile with few or no changes to spread across any and all accessible compute cores, including ones in the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Open:</strong> I mentioned that Microsoft intends to make the C++ AMP specification open, and encourages its implementation on other C++ compilers for any hardware or OS target. AMD announced that they will implement C++ AMP in their FSA reference compiler. NVidia also announced support.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;re really excited about this, and I hope you find the information in the talk to be useful. A prerelease implementation in Visual C++ that runs on Windows will be available later this year. More to come&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Channel 9 just posted a new <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Conversation-with-Herb-Sutter-Perspectives-on-Modern-C0x11">interview with me</a> about ISO C++0x, C++&#8217;s place in the modern world, and all things C++. The topics we talked about ranged pretty widely, as you can see from the questions below.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the blurb as posted on Channel 9 with links to specific questions in the interview. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Herb</p>
<blockquote><p>I was lucky enough to catch up with <a href="https://herbsutter.com/" target="_blank">Herb Sutter</a> not too long after the <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2011/03/25/we-have-fdis-trip-report-march-2011-c-standards-meeting/" target="_blank">FDIS announcement</a> (Final Draft International Standard is complete).</p>
<p>As usual when talking to Herb, the conversation is all about C++ (well, we <em>do</em> talk about C# for a little while, but in the context of C++. Why? Tune in&#8230;).</p>
<p>See below for the specific questions that were asked. You can simply click on a link to move directly to that point in the conversation. I do, however, strongly recommend that <em>you watch the entire thing</em>. I also recommend that you don&#8217;t get used to this level of categorization in my videos (it takes a fair amount of time to do this sort of thing, so enjoy the times when I actually do this, but don&#8217;t expect me to do this all of the time).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always great to talk to Herb and get a glimpse of what goes on in the C++ Standards Committee (which Herb chairs). In this specific conversation, it&#8217;s uplifting to see how excited Herb is for the future of one of the world&#8217;s most capable and widely used general purpose programming languages. C++ is a modern programming language for power and performance, but it&#8217;s also a highly abstracted general purpose language for building user mode applications, mobile apps, etc. The amazing part is how C++ can provide rich general programming abstractions and also ensure that your code can run at machine speeds. We talk about this, of course.</p>
<p>Tune in. Learn. Go native!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a couple of months, I&#8217;ll be giving a keynote at the <a href="http://developer.amd.com/afds/">AMD Fusion Developer&#8217;s Summit</a>, which will be held on June 13-16, 2011, in Bellevue, WA, USA.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my talk&#8217;s description as it <a href="http://developer.amd.com/afds/pages/keynote.aspx">appears</a> on the conference website:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><a href="http://developer.amd.com/afds/pages/keynote.aspx">AFDS Keynote: “Heterogeneous Parallelism at Microsoft”</a></strong><br />
<em>Herb Sutter, Microsoft Principal Architect, Native Languages</em></p>
<p>Parallelism is not just in full bloom, but increasingly in full variety. We know that getting full computational performance out of most machines—nearly all desktops and laptops, most game consoles, and the newest smartphones—already means harnessing local parallel hardware, mainly in the form of multicore CPU processing. This is the commoditization of the supercomputer.</p>
<p>More and more, however, getting that full performance can also mean using gradually ever-more-heterogeneous processing, from local GPGPU and Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) flavors to “often-on” remote parallel computing power in the form of elastic compute clouds. This is the generalization of the heterogeneous cluster in all its NUMA glory, and it’s appearing at all scales from on-die to on-machine to on-cloud.</p>
<p>In this talk, Microsoft’s chief native languages architect shares a vision of what this will mean for native software on Microsoft platforms from servers to devices, and showcases upcoming innovations that bring access to increasingly heterogeneous compute resources — from vector units and multicore, to GPGPU and APU, to elastic cloud — directly into the world’s most popular native languages.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in high performance code for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPGPU">GPUs</a>, <a href="http://sites.amd.com/us/fusion/apu/Pages/fusion.aspx">APUs</a>, and other high-performance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym">TLAs</a>, I hope to see you there.</p>
<p>Note: This talk is related to, but different from, the <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/02/session-announcement-c-and-the-gpu-and-beyond/">GPU talk I&#8217;ll be presenting</a> in August at <em><a href="https://herbsutter.com/2011/04/05/c-and-beyond-2011/">C++ and Beyond 2011</a></em> (aka C&amp;B). You can expect the above keynote to be, well, keynote-y&#8230; oriented toward software product features and of course AMD&#8217;s hardware, with plenty of forward-looking industry vision style material. My <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/2011/04/02/session-announcement-c-and-the-gpu-and-beyond/">August C&amp;B technical talk</a> will be just that, an in-depth performance-oriented and sometimes-gritty technical session that will also mention product-related and hardware-specific stuff but is primarily about heterogeneous hardware, with a more pragmatically focused forward-looking eye.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those of you who may be interested in concurrency and parallelism using Microsoft tools, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2011/03/15/10139453.aspx">new book</a> now available on the Visual C++ 2010 Parallel Patterns Library (PPL). I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>Normally I don&#8217;t write about other people&#8217;s platform-specific books, but I happened to be involved in the design of PPL, thought the book was nicely done, and contributed a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg663537.aspx">Foreword</a>. Here&#8217;s what I wrote to introduce the book:</p>
<blockquote><p>This timely book comes as we navigate a major turning point in our industry: parallel hardware + mobile devices = the pocket supercomputer as the mainstream platform for the next 20 years.</p>
<p>Parallel applications are increasingly needed to exploit all kinds of target hardware. As I write this, getting full computational performance out of most machines—nearly all desktops and laptops, most game consoles, and the newest smartphones—already means harnessing local parallel hardware, mainly in the form of multicore CPU processing; this is the commoditization of the supercomputer. Increasingly in the coming years, getting that full performance will also mean using gradually ever-more-heterogeneous processing, from local general-purpose computation on graphics processing units (GPGPU) flavors to harnessing &#8220;often-on&#8221; remote parallel computing power in the form of elastic compute clouds; this is the generalization of the heterogeneous cluster in all its NUMA glory, with instantiations ranging from on-die to on-machine to on-cloud, with early examples of each kind already available in the wild.</p>
<p>Starting now and for the foreseeable future, for compute-bound applications, &#8220;fast&#8221; will be synonymous not just with &#8220;parallel,&#8221; but with &#8220;<em>scalably</em> parallel.&#8221; Only scalably parallel applications that can be shipped with lots of latent concurrency beyond what can be exploited in this year’s mainstream machines will be able to enjoy the new Free Lunch of getting substantially faster when today’s binaries can be installed and blossom on tomorrow’s hardware that will have more parallelism.</p>
<p>Visual C++ 2010 with its Parallel Patterns Library (PPL), described in this book, helps enable applications to take the first steps down this new path as it continues to unfold. During the design of PPL, many people did a lot of heavy lifting. For my part, I was glad to be able to contribute the heavy emphasis on lambda functions as the key central language extension that enabled the rest of PPL to be built as Standard Template Library (STL)-like algorithms implemented as a normal library. We could instead have built a half-dozen new kinds of special-purpose parallel loops into the language itself (and almost did), but that would have been terribly invasive and non-general. Adding a single general-purpose language feature like lambdas that can be used everywhere, including with PPL but not limited to only that, is vastly superior to baking special cases into the language.</p>
<p>The good news is that, in large parts of the world, we have as an industry already achieved pervasive computing: the vision of putting a computer on every desk, in every living room, and in everyone’s pocket. But now we are in the process of delivering pervasive and even elastic supercomputing: putting a supercomputer on every desk, in every living room, and in everyone’s pocket, with both local and non-local resources. In 1984, when I was just finishing high school, the world’s fastest computer was a Cray X-MP with four processors, 128MB of RAM, and peak performance of 942MFLOPS—or, put another way, a fraction of the parallelism, memory, and computational power of a 2005 vintage Xbox, never mind modern &#8220;phones&#8221; and Kinect. We’ve come a long way, and the pace of change is not only still strong, but still accelerating.</p>
<p>The industry turn to parallelism that has begun with multicore CPUs (for the reasons I outlined a few years ago in my essay &#8220;The Free Lunch Is Over&#8221;) will continue to be accelerated by GPGPU computing, elastic cloud computing, and other new and fundamentally parallel trends that deliver vast amounts of new computational power in forms that will become increasingly available to us through our mainstream programming languages. At Microsoft, we’re very happy to be able to be part of delivering this and future generations of tools for mainstream parallel computing across the industry. With PPL in particular, I’m very pleased to see how well the final product has turned out and look forward to seeing its capabilities continue to grow as we re-enable the new Free Lunch applications—scalable parallel applications ready for our next 20 years.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At PDC 2010 this week, I participated in a panel and gave one talk. Both are now online for live on-demand viewing.</p>
<p><strong>Note: The talks should work on any browser.</strong> They <span style="text-decoration:underline;">do not</span> require Silverlight. If you get a message that Silverlight is needed, it just made a mistake in auto-detecting your browser (I&#8217;m told this happens with Firefox sometimes), so just click on one of the alternate formats and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob's_your_uncle">Bob&#8217;s your uncle</a>.</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/bU23S2">1. Languages Panel</a> (update: <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/PDC/PDC10/FT11">new link</a>)</strong></p>
<p>I got to participate again this year on a fun panel on programming languages and software development, together with fellow panelists <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/techfellow/hejlsberg/default.mspx">Anders Hejlsberg</a> (creator of Turbo Pascal, Delphi, and C#), <a href="http://bracha.org/Site/Home.html">Gilad Bracha</a> (of Java and Newspeak fame), and <a href="http://www.caplet.com/">Mark S. Miller</a> (of Ecmascript and E and general security fame). Our esteemed moderator, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/emeijer/">Erik Meijer</a>, is one of the original designers of LINQ in C# and has contributed heavily to many other languages.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/dcJcXN">2. Lambdas, Lambdas Everywhere</a> (update: <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/PDC/PDC10/FT13">new link</a>)</strong></p>
<p>This is a shortened version of the full lambdas talk I gave at C&amp;B on Wednesday, and will be giving again at <a href="http://cppandbeyond.com/">C++ and Beyond Encore</a> this December. To get the full talk, come to C&amp;B Encore&#8230; but to get a good chunk of it, check out this version online.</p>
<p>Note: Just before the talk, I went around the room to chat with individual attendees, and discovered that a lot of the audience members were C# programmers who didn&#8217;t realize this was a C++ talk. Just before we went live, I spoke up to the room and alerted everywhere about that, and nearly everyone stayed anyway, which was nice. But if you wonder why I mentioned C# lambdas a number of times to this audience, that&#8217;s why.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/09/15/bott-ie9">John Gruber wrote</a> about Internet Explorer 9:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new UI removes most of the junk from the UI. Kind of interesting how web browsers have evolved to expose fewer UI elements. Most apps go the other way over time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, that’s because the page/site is the real app. And like most apps they are indeed going the other way.</p>
<p>The browser is not really an app; it’s a shell, like the OS shell, just a runtime necessity to run the real app and provide some convenience housekeeping tools. Shells generally try to remove clutter (though admittedly this goes in waves) because they know they’re not the main attraction.</p>

</strong>This is the VC++ team’s overview, side by side with the previous release. Includes handy links to the C++ committee paper numbers.</p>
<p>See also Scott Meyers’ <a href="http://www.aristeia.com/C++0x/C++0xFeatureAvailability.htm">C++0x feature availability tracker</a> for gcc and VC++, which is fairly up to date although it primarily represents the compiler versions and features that Scott has exercised personally, not necessarily the latest compiler or all features that are actually supported.</p>
<h3>Other interesting stuff</h3>
<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2010/04/ipad-review.ars/"><strong>Ars Technica Reviews the iPad</strong></a><strong> (Ars Technica)<br />
</strong>Here’s a good example why I often like Ars reviews better than those at other “gizmo” sites (you know who you are). Whereas lots of other sites climbed over each other to be the first to breathlessly post reviews based on <em>using the iPad simulator</em> rather than having real hardware in hand and <em>actually using the device</em> they’re reviewing, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/04/wheres-the-ars-technica-ipad-review.ars">Ars waited until their reviewers could report based on actually using the device personally.</a> What a refreshing idea!</p>
<p>Of course, to make it a no-brainer purchase for me, it still <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2010/04/01/links-i-enjoyed-reading-this-week-3/">needs a stylus and OneNote</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Appetizers: Three cool links</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Essays-Computer-Scientist-ebook/dp/B003DKG5H6"><em>The Design of Design</em> by Fred Brooks</a> (Amazon)<br />
</strong>Yes, a new book by <em>the</em> Fred Brooks. Started reading it in Stanza on my iPhone today…</p>
<p><a href="http://aturingmachine.com/"><strong>A Turing Machine</strong></a><strong> (aturingmachine.com)<br />
</strong>I’m in love. This is my favorite computer ever. I <em>so</em> want one.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/Articles/2010/04/01/The-Evolution-of-Visual-C-in-Visual-Studio-2010.aspx">The Evolution of Visual C++ in Visual Studio 2010</a> (VS Magazine)<br />
</strong>A summary of what’s new in VC++ 2010, from the C++0x language and library features, to concurrency runtime and libraries, to faster and more accurate Intellisense (running the EDG engine), and more. All I can say is that VS 2010 is available imminently…</p>
<h3>Entree: My favorite link this week</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/mobility/222700087">What the iPad Really Is</a> (Michael Swaine, Dr. Dobb’s)<br />
</strong>Swaine gets it. The iPad is a “read-mostly” and “anywhere” device.</p>
<p>That’s why Steve Jobs is correct that this segment between notebooks and phones exists, and that serving that segment expands the market rather than competing directly with either neighboring segment. The tablet, spelled with “i” or otherwise, mostly doesn’t compete with desktops and notebooks (except for users who only do read-mostly stuff) or smartphones (except for users who need a bigger screen); it complements both. I’ve been using Windows convertible tablets off and on for years for this part of my computing life.</p>
<p>For my tablet needs, the iPad as launched had only two disappointments. The killer piece of missing software was a OneNote equivalent, and the killer piece of missing hardware was a stylus – really, because I want to finally have a real paper-notebook replacement. My convertible tablet/notebook has these covered, but maybe if a dedicated tablet can match this part too it can take over the “tablet segment” for me and I can go back to a notebook that’s a dedicated notebook. We’ll see.</p>
<p>Incidentally, now with Netflix (if it’s not a 4/1 joke) and Hulu and Flickr and ABC joining the burgeoning flood, it looks more and more like <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/04/netflix-hulu-cbs-abc-ted-flickr-more-readying-for-ipad.ars">“iPad, iPad everywhere”</a>…</p>
