					<description><![CDATA[It is a bit of a shame this is the 3:d publication CMP cancels (and as always they do so without warning and information) in fact I just renewd my subscription so I hope they will refund me the money). Anyways, the main question: are there any &quot;e-book-readers&quot; that can read the online edition?

I have been looking into this for quite some time, magazines for me are for reading to/from work, when i am &quot;not at my computer&quot;, so I would gladly accept a digital edition (since I live in Sweden and have to pay quite a lot to get things shipped over here) but I would like to read it offline on the subway to work.

So are there any e-books someone can recomend me that can read magazines offline?

					<description><![CDATA[A web site is a sorry replacement for a print publication. And a bad site, like DDJ, is no replacement for even a beaten-down publication. Thanks, UBM, for murdering still another institution.Not to say CMP/UBM have been alone among publishers in racing to the bottom in an attempt to do everything on the cheap. It&#039;s a societal phenomenon and the publishing manifestation of maximizing short-term profitability for owners has been to use the internet primarily as a cost-cutting tool rather than looking what the best use of the medium would be from an overall business standpoint. Rather than seeking to find synergy between established media and new media, publishers have sucked the life out of their print publications in favor of cheap web postings with the idea that either the print profits will not be damaged in the process or that double dipping on some advertising will offset lost print revenue and circulation. It&#039;s a silly idea that that has repeatedly failed. Not everyone wants to follow print links to the web, and some people can&#039;t. More, if the print publication becomes an elaborate, fee-based ad for a web site, it rapidly becomes a disposable expense for formerly happy readers. Thus the spread of the &quot;free&quot; subscription, which trades demographical information from the subscriber for what increasingly isn&#039;t just advertising supported content but is either largely a print pointer to an ad-driven and often unusable web site or the articles themselves tend to be written by or about advertisers. It&#039;s nauseatingly cynical, but, worse, it&#039;s suicidal. Publishers have whined about market conditions killing them for a few years now, but the harm done to publishing is essentially all self-inflicted.If I weren&#039;t too sick to work, I could make a wagon of money as an anti-MBA teaching these people how not to burst into flames. But it is, alas, too late for DDJ and its geek-mag stablemates. So too for many newspapers, which is for many reasons far more unconscionable.]]></description>

MacTech Magazine (originally programming on the Mac, but now for all techs on the Mac) is not [only] still in print — and not only that, has had the best year since the dot com days.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right, Mactech would be Mac&#8217;s rough equivalent of MSDN Magazine. That&#8217;s the kind of publication I had in mind when I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>As of next month, the only major technical programmer’s trade magazines still available in print, that I know of, are <b>platform- and technology-specific ones</b> like asp.netPRO and MSDN Magazine — and even those increasingly feature online-only content.</p></blockquote>
<p>The observation was that DDJ was the last general programming print magazine I know of that covered a variety of technologies and platforms.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry to see DDJ go web only -- as a long time fan.  Actually, unless the statement is about the Windows market only, there&#039;s a mis-statement in this article.

MacTech Magazine (originally programming on the Mac, but now for all techs on the Mac) is not still in print -- and not only that, has had the best year since the dot com days.  MacTech this week is at the show this week and has announced:

* Significant readership growth in print
* Highest ad revenue since dot com days
* Significant growth in page count over the last year
* Significant growth in online unique visitors

So, it&#039;s not about magazines in general.  There were something like 20x more magazines launched in 2008 than there were ones that closed down.

It&#039;s about specific situations, and giving the readers what they want. 

Thanks,
Neil Ticktin

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been subscribing to DDJ since about 1994/5.

It gets thinner and thinner. I noticed a particular decline in the magazine after CMP got hold of it (just like with Windows Developer Journal - which they ultimately killed).

I was most cheesed off when the DDJ website went &quot;subscription only&quot; which meant that if you lived outside the US and received your subscription from a local distributor you did not have access to the articles on the DDJ website.

Emails to DDJ about how to rectify this went unanswered.

Finally, I want to read paper not a screen. I read a screen all day at work. When I want to read a tech journal, or a non-tech journal, book, I want to read a book, on paper.

Consider my subscription cancelled.

Very, very disappointing.

					<description><![CDATA[No! DDJ is the only paid trade magazine subscription I have left. It is one of two of my subscriptions that use the nxtbook facility for the online editions. Each month I download a copy of their nxtbook and PDF formats for backup purposes, but what I actually read is the print edition. The nxtbook format is far too hideous to actually use. More importantly, my DDJ reading time involves time away from my computer with my feet up. I&#039;m not giving up that time to return to the computer - I spend too much time on the computer as is. If DDJ is abandoning the print edition, then I have to abandon DDJ in favour of other print material. Herb, I love your columns, but I&#039;ve never read a single one of them online. I was already feeling rather cheated by DDJ given the magazine&#039;s ever dwindling tissue-thin thickness. Surely they aren&#039;t thinking they can actually charge money for an online-only edition? I think DDJ has just put a bullet in it&#039;s own head.]]></description>
