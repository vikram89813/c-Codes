					<description><![CDATA[Hey Herb,

Things have been busy for you! That must have been quite the technical review to have...good to see that Bill is interested in the work being done with C++0x.

Maybe we should go shopping for more blue shirts when you are here!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb.

Hopefully you were talking to Bill about Lambdas and other features (like those native concurrency tools you mentioned a while back now...) that will be in VC 10 and maybe even a release date? Care to share yet? ;). By the way I noticed all the team members have vanished off the side bar of the VC Team Blog site. So is it just you that&#039;s left now? :)

It would be nice to see a bit more prolific blogging (a la Scott Gu&#039; style coming out of the VC team). I know that&#039;s easy for me to say as it is you guys that have to write it. But I am wishing after all! :)

So maybe it&#039;s time you did a BBC C++0x special! I suggest calling it the VC10 news at 6! Since 10 is apparently the new 6 I hope it comes soon because I&#039;m tried of hearing the VC6 news for the last 10 years! ;)

Keep up the good work!]]></description>

Good to see you on the Beeb.  Disappointed they didn&#039;t show you playing the keyboards and trying to get a room full of geeks to sing in tune!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes the documentary was on last night, screened on the &quot;The Money Programme&quot;.  I thought that chap writing on the board looked and sounded familiar, talking about pointers if i recall!.  I was actually surprised that Mr Gates was in this type of meeting, even more impressed that he was in touch with the latest tech...hmm guess that&#039;s how you make a billion i guess.

You can view the documentary here - http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00c6sdc]]></description>
