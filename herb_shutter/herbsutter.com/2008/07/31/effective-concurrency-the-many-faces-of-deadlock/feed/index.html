					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb,

    I would like to say thank you very much for this article of deadlock, especially for one of its faces about message. Since I&#039;m a developer of Chinese input method, there&#039;s always something mysterious to me such as why ImmGenerateMessage is better to be invoked by non-member (even global) function rather than member function that may be involved within stack/heap. This article provides a clearer hint to my situation: maybe I have more  blocks than I assumed, including OS, IMM32, my RPC client-server, my C# and C++/CLR GUI, and so on......]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi

I find this article one of the most important one in this series of articles. I have a question regarding this code:

// Global data Mutex mut;
 MessageQueue queue;

// Thread 1 
 mut.lock();  // A 
queue.receive(); // B: blocks 
mut.unlock(); 

// Thread 2 
 mut.lock(); // C: blocks 
 queue.send( msg );

I guess that there is no way to escape the deadlock considering this single queue approach that is not synchronized between sending/receiving by other means.
What could be possible solutions to that problem ?]]></description>
