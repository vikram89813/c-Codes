					<description><![CDATA[@ jsphadetula: It &lt;code&gt;std::is_constant_evaluated()&lt;/code&gt; is not &quot;immediately evaluated&quot; on its own.  In fact, calling it as a condition for constexpr if-statement is probably never what you want:
[code]
constexpr int f() {
  if constexpr (std::is_constant_evaluated()) {  // Always true!
    return 42;
  } else {
    throw 42;  // Never evaluated.
  }
}
[/code]

BTW, codifying &lt;code&gt;std::is_constant_evaluated()&lt;/code&gt; turned out to be _much_ harder than anticipated. Shout-out to Richard Smith for helping us getting it right (and understanding various constraints of other implementations), as well as the Core Working Group (CWG) for a thorough review process that unearthed some really interesting (and mind-bending!) bugs in our original wording.

					<description><![CDATA[While I realize the idea behind the metaclass proposal is to fold interface, property, COM class, etc. into one language feature, the way it&#039;s being described, especially with the class(foo) syntax, and the possible class(foo, bar, bat, etc.) expansion to it, it seems like it&#039;s some kind of class aspects feature, and I would imagine they&#039;d be more often used in a composed way, where a library is written with a bunch of common patterns as metaclasses, and then every class just uses some combination of them. Basically, I&#039;d expect to see something like a Gang of Four library where every pattern is in there, and it&#039;s easy to just do something like class(factory, observer), rather than implementing those patterns by hand.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are metaclasses going to be out in the wild around the same time as C++20, as TS at least?

As side note (Bjarne&#039;s talk), I liked the originally proposed terse syntax much better than the trailing auto we are going to get (const Sortable&#038; versus const Sortable auto&#038;). If I write Sortable&#038;&#038;, *of course* it is a forwarding reference, specifying a concept is not the same as specifying a type!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great talk, thanks! I know the metaclass syntax is still in flux, and the feature may not even make it all the way to the standard, but please, please, please fight back against this &quot;class(etc)&quot; nonsense.

I can live with the other syntax changes in the authoring side of things, taking a read-only source argument and generating the output. That seems an entirely reasonable alternative. It seems likely that authoring metaclasses will be limited to experts, either for standardisation or within organisations, so either way the syntax won&#039;t affect a huge population.

But the whole point of metaclasses, IMO, is for the users! With the greatest respect to all the committee people donating their time and expertise, they need to be reminded who this language is for. I for one want to write &quot;interface IEnumerable&quot; and &quot;property Name&quot; and &quot;collection linked_list&quot; and so on and I&#039;d be mightily surprised if a survey of C++ users disagreed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just watched the talk on youtube, really great one. One comment about the syntax change with class() really got me thinking about how metaclasses could be used when combined with each other.
I came up with a different implementation (or at least some kind of sketch) of your property example (https://godbolt.org/z/1tE3Hy), where the property support can be opted in and property members are just marked.
There are a lot of things I don&#039;t know how they work but it is still a lot of fun to play around with this feature.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It might be good to some examples showing the treatment of Values. For example consider https://godbolt.org/z/zyNhXh
[code]class X {
public:
    X() : a(new int(0)), b(new char(0)) {}
    int&#038; get_a() { return *a; }
    char&#038; get_b() { return *b; }
private:
    unique_ptr&#060;int&#062; a;
    unique_ptr&#060;char&#062; b;
};[/code]
X can&#039;t be an Owner or Pointer and it isn&#039;t an Aggregate. It appears to me there is no possible valid lifetime annotation for the return values of get_a and get_b. It also appears that the inferred return psets will be {static}. Is that correct?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Greg Yes, this is the 5th talk in a line that deserves to be connected together by a Simplicity theme, because that&#039;s what motivates the topics. The topics otherwise look very different, but all are motivated and tied together by that central theme, and are central to achieving that theme.

In slightly more detail:

CppCon 2014: How to use smart pointers (remove classes of errors with manual delete), how to initialize variables, and how to pass parameters (just the latter is ~9% of all published C++ rules, seriously, no kidding... I counted)

CppCon 2015: The Guidelines launch, and the Lifetime profile in particular to address dangling pointers/iterators/etc. (both about encouraging simpler code and removing classes of errors and latent bugs)

CppCon 2016: How to use smart pointers (in more detail), and leak-freedom to address the cases where we do need to express actual or potential cycles (experimental approach of tactical GC arenas)

CppCon 2017: Mini intro on spaceship comparison, then reflection+generation+metaclasses to simplify writing classes (for both comparisons and class authoring, the common theme is less boilerplate + removing classes of errors)

So simplicity is the theme that ties them together.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[(I just realized my comment below got messed up, so I repeat it here)

As a small comment to yaafcd (p1141r0):

It says “We are willing to tolerate this small potential for ambiguity.”
Wouldn’t it make slightly more sense to have constrained type template-parameters have the regular syntax &lt;code&gt;template&#060;Contrain typename T&#062; foo()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;template&#060;Constrain class T&#062; foo()&lt;/code&gt; and then additionally add the relaxation that &lt;code&gt;template&#060;Constrain T&#062; foo()&lt;/code&gt; is allowed? That would make the rules symmetric to &lt;code&gt;Constain auto x&lt;/code&gt; and again allows for a style that has no ambiguities. Therefore it would not need the admission above.

Still I’m really glad to see that there’s finally a good proposal which most people are willing to support. :)

And I’m really excited that range-adaptors could actually make their way into C++20 :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a small comment to yaafcd (p1141r0):

You wrote &quot;We are willing to tolerate this small potential for ambiguity.&quot;
Wouldn&#039;t it make slightly more sense to have constrained type template-parameters have the regular syntax &quot;template  foo()&quot; or &quot;template  foo()&quot; and then additionally add the relaxation that &quot;template foo()&quot; is allowed? That would make the rules symmetric to &quot;Constain auto x&quot; and again allows for a style that has no ambiguities. Therefore it would not need the admission above.

Still I&#039;m really glad to see that there&#039;s finally a good proposal which most people are willing to support. :)

And I&#039;m really excited that range-adaptors could actually make their way into C++20 :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The terminate-on-OOM mindset really worries me. As an owner of a system component DLL, we can&#039;t just go terminating a whole process because some bad font had a table that was too large, and I certainly do not want my own application being terminated because the user tried to load some huge JPEG (I have some images that are hundreds of MB&#039;s when loaded).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@J

&quot;I think terminating on a OOM makes much more sense than throwing exceptions.&quot;

Terminate what? The whole process or the thread in which it occurred?
If my process can keep running in the face of 1 thread having an OOM, then I would much rather that, than kill the whole thing. 

I&#039;d argue that would make for more reliable software, as an OOM (due to memory pressure or fragmentation) can sometimes be a transitory condition that passes, meaning multi-threaded long-running processes can potentially keep going regardless.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Adrian

I&#039;ve been thinking about fragmentation.  The only reason you cannot defragment C++ memory today is someone might send a pointer to someplace not trackable as a pointer.  I&#039;ve seen two cases of this: you cast it to &quot;an int&quot; and do some math that you latter undo and cast back; or you send the pointer elsewhere (ie the network) and latter get it back (these are probably undefined behavior).  For all pointers they point to nullptr, someplace within the object in question, or one beyond the object. Thus if you ignore those cases it is possible for the compiler to track/find all the pointers, and when compaction is needed move/relocated the objects wherever and change the pointers.

If someone wants to run with this, feel free. I think it can work but there are many tricky things that I can&#039;t possibly think of much less put into a proposal. I do not require credit for my tiny idea.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It always concerns me when people think and talk about OOM (out of memory) when it comes to allocation failure.  An allocation failure does not necessarily mean that you&#039;re out of memory.  In my experience, the most frequent cause of allocation failure is address space fragmentation, not memory exhaustion.  You don&#039;t even need a memory leak for that to happen.

Thinking about all allocation failures as OOM limits the thinking about the causes, solutions, and error reporting strategies that should be used.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Florian Rudolf: &quot;Concerning contracts, are there plans to support overloading with contracts?&quot;

I hope not. Contracts aren&#039;t concepts, and having two functions with two different contracts ought to mean having two different algorithms behind them. And a different algorithm should be spelled with a different name.

That is, if there&#039;s a version of `my_algorithm` that takes a sorted list and one that doesn&#039;t, then these are two separate algorithms and users should pick which one to call based on that data. If you have a vector, then you know that it is sorted, either because you [[requires]] that it was sorted, or some function [[ensures]] that it is sorted. Either way, you the caller of `my_algorithm` is perfectly aware of the sorting status of the vector. So just call the right algorithm.

Overload resolution is complex enough; let&#039;s not give people the ability to add arbitrarily many layers of complexity to them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The OOM paradigm switch idea is interesting, but relying in global state for disabling retroactive changes to how it works sounds really concerning. Maybe this could be opted in by using tools in std2 namespace or something? Is std2 becoming a reality anyway?

I sort of disagree with P0709r1 1.1 (2). Consider a program that runs some sort of not really well trusted submodule, for instance an IDE which interprets an in-progress, possibly buggy program, or an X server which runs a session for a possibly buggy client. Bugs in these are &quot;kinda-recoverable&quot;, you can&#039;t recover the module, but it&#039;s likely you can recover the state of whole program. Maybe I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m talking about? The rest of the document appears to be great. Have you considered reporting no error by using a hidden error domain of no error on the ABI side, as much as that must be ludicrous while the code side of error structure is explicitly designed to not indicate success?]]></description>
