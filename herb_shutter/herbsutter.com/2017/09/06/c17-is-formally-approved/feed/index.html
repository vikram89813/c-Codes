					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb!
Looking at the features that C++17 brings, one of the changes deeply concerned me. If you have the time, could you please have a look at https://isocpp.org/forums/iso-c-standard-discussion?place=topic%2Fstd-discussion%2FDMMeyEkZgv0%2Fdiscussion and share your perspective?
Thanks,
Gevorg]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is there an upstream source of news on this? You presumably heard about it by being on the C++ committee, but that doesn’t work for the general public. I heard about it by watching https://github.com/cplusplus/draft, but I would have expected to see something at https://www.iso.org/standard/68564.html first. Since the iso.org page hasn’t changed, is there some other location accessible by the general public to follow news and details about this process? I still don’t know where I can read the DIS balloting comments, except on the bug tracker of the github repository.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@lpv: See https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard, which will be updated for C++17 when it is available.

The actual formal C++ standard is always &quot;for sale only&quot; (ISO rules). However, you can find draft snapshots around the time it&#039;s finalized which are very similar, and freely available.
