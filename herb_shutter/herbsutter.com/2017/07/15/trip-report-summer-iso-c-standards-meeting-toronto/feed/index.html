					<description><![CDATA[@Jere: The syntax of designated initializers is consistent with C.  There would have to be *overwhelming* advantages for the committee to go with some other syntax.

On named arguments, Bjarne Stroustrup has always been opposed to named arguments (on the grounds that they encourage over-long argument lists).  See Design and Evolution of C++.  Obviously he isn&#039;t a Benevolent Dictator for Life, but his opinion *does* still have weight.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the idea (maybe not the syntax) of the designated initializers.  It&#039;s one step closer to what Ada refers to as Named Association which is extremely powerful in making designs appear more clean.  Using the dot before might be an easy to miss (and spot) mistype.

I hope one day that C++ (and C) could get something analogous to Named Association.  Right now in both, if you default all or most of the parameters, if the user wants to change just one of the defaults, they have to specify all the defaults up to that one.  With named association, that is no longer the case:

//imagine this with lots more than just 3 defaulted parameters
void SetupSomeMicroTimer(period_t p = ONE_SECOND, bit_mode_t m=MODE_32_BIT, callback_t * c=null);

//not C or C++ code
SetupSomeMicroTimer( c =&#062; &#038;MyTimerCallback );  //or whatever syntax.  Here, both p and m are still defaulted

The nice thing here is that it doesn&#039;t break any old code since &quot;not using&quot; named association uses the existing rules, but now new code can look cleaner and be easier to use (especially if you are using a poorly documented 3rd party library and you are hesitant about specifying some of the other parameters outside of the one you want to change).

The same would apply to object initialization:]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Raphaël &quot;You have dots in front of member identifiers. Would that break something to not have them ?&quot;

1) That would make the feature incompatible with the C equivalent.

2) It would create parsing issues. Remember: &quot;x = 1&quot; is an expression in C and C++. So if the compiler sees that, it doesn&#039;t know if that&#039;s a designated initializer for a member or an expression whose result should use non-designated initializer rules. Having a dot there disambiguates the code.

@Bender: &quot;your code example is ugly, I would just skip the naming rather than using that ugly code.&quot;

In what way? In the vast majority of code, you don&#039;t need to name the parameters of the function you&#039;re calling. Usually, what those parameters are is obvious locally from variable names, types, the function name, etc. So named parameters is a feature you only need rarely.

So rather than getting a dedicated &quot;named parameter&quot; feature, we get a general feature that can be used for named parameters, but is slightly more inconvenient to use.

How ugly using braces is is of course in the eyes of the beholder. To me, it&#039;s not that bad. And it makes it clear that I&#039;m invoking a &quot;named parameter&quot; call, rather than just a regular function call.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Bender: &quot;One should be able to do this for class constructor also (where x, y , z are constructor arguments).&quot;

No. Constructors are just functions. If you can call constructors with named arguments, then you should be able to call functions with named arguments.

Fortunately, designated initializers are good enough to serve this purpose:

struct constructor_params { int x, float y, std::string z }; //Aggregate

class type
{
public:
  type(constructor_params cp); //Access parameters as cp.x and so forth.
};

type value{.x = 5, .y = 10.4f, .z = &quot;foo&quot;};]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062; except only the “introducer syntax” and “terse/natural syntax”

What about the other concepts issues? Do we still have to use `concept bool`, or is `concept` enough? Are there still function and variable concepts, or are concepts just variables, or are they their own thing now? Were there *any* substantive changes to the nature of concepts, or did they just do a copy/paste of Concepts TS into the standard (minus those two points)?]]></description>
