					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I just came to know about the upcoming &quot;High-Performance and Low-Latency C++&quot; event in Stockholm and very much interested in attending this event. 

However, I just wanted to know if the attendees will be provided with any presentation material, code samples etc that we can refer to during and after the event in order to delve deeper into this subject. Though I have been developing in C++ for a while now, I am fairly new to High-Performance and Low-Latency programming and I am afraid it will be difficult for me to understand and retain all the material covered in a short span of 3 days without any supporting material.

Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Contemplations about C++ future simplifications are very exciting. It seems (from an admittedly outsider point of view) that a big obstacle for this is a backward compatibility promise. Backward compatibility is a wonderful thing and a core language strength. That said, may it be that the language has reached the point when bigger deprecations are possible without breaking user&#039;s perception of backward compatibility?

Code is data to a compiler and our current compilers take more and more metadata with the code. But surprisingly one of most important matadata bits is detached from the code into a build process - C++ language standard compliance is a compiler flag. Would it be more reasonable to have it in the code? More so, if language versioning goes in the code, it better not be per-file (that is too brittle), but should be either per namespace or per (upcoming) modules. If one can set both lower and upper boundaries, then the compiler knows which features to turn on for the upper boundary and which features to turn off or deprecate, for the lower boundary. The lower end&#039;s default is zero, unless a new language feature conflicts with something which was deprecated. Feels that if we can find a proper scoping for languave compliance it may help to aleviate backward compatibility concerns, - and give language designers more freedom for consistent design with less corner cases.

May be other lessons from protocol vestioning are applicable. But it feels that an ability to drop luggage for greenfield opportunity codebases would worth the effort.

					<description><![CDATA[@Najjar, @ihor: Not all events have a recording setup... the Stockholm seminar won&#039;t be recorded, and I don&#039;t know yet about arrangements at ACCU.

However, you can find lots of articles and talks online: All of my articles have always been freely available online, several hundred including on many on these topics -- check out the &quot;effective concurrency&quot; tag on this blog.

					<description><![CDATA[Since I can&#039;t get to Stockholm,
Is there any way to purchase videos and
Handouts afterwards?
I assume that it may be a while before
This gets published.
