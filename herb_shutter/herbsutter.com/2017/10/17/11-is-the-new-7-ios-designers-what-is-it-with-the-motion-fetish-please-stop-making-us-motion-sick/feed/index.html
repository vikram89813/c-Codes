					<description><![CDATA[Urgh. I don’t get motion sickness from anything. Not small boats in a force 9 gale, not aerobatics in light aircraft, but iOS11 just gives me the urge to un-have lunch. I found the reduce motion setting within 20 minutes of installation but the lock screen jumping still sets me off as it’s so jarring. I have no choice but to use apple as it’s a company iphone. My personal phone will remain android so long as it doesn’t go down apple’s stupid route of incessant meddling of things that aren’t broken and fisher-price UI design. Can’t imagine the design team will take any notice, but bravo for mentioning it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t say I suffer much from motion sickness myself, however, but I&#039;ve heard friends say, what really gets them is the lack of a fixed focal point, for instance with the parallaxing background how it moves the background around, thus moving the one thing, you thought you could count on to stay put.

Anywho, the point is: Maybe your wife would feel less motion sick, if you disable the Reduced Motion, and simply change the background to a static non-moving one? When you change the background (from Settings) you get to choose if you want a static picture, or a parallaxing background. This way, sure the icons will move about, but the background stays put, even the lock screen -- and maybe that is enough to ease her stomach? one could hope :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@mjanes: Literally. (I literally said &quot;literally&quot; in the first line.)

@Ourgon: We didn&#039;t buy a defective product; it was not defective when we bought it, a couple of years ago. This happened to existing phones as an OS upgrade, with no way to roll back.

Re Android: Yes, as I mentioned, we are considering fleeing to Android, even though a switch is nontrivial because of ecosystem/app lockin, and of course Android has it own disadvantages. This isn&#039;t a complaint about quirks or irritations, every OS will have those and for those one should just suffer in silence; this case is literally about being able to look at it to use it at all.

One reason I mention it here is because this lesson applies when upgrading anything, including a programming language. C++ also has its share of new feature proposals that are &quot;cool bells and whistles&quot; but that can fall victim to the law of unintended consequences; we try very hard to say no to those, or no to the needlessly-cute parts. It is very easy to break customers, including by accident. So as we evolve C++ we are trying to follow the same advice to focus on consistent design principles, follow &quot;design is how it works,&quot; and avoid the &quot;too cute&quot; pitfall. We aren&#039;t perfect, the more so because we&#039;re a committee, but design and UX principles are very horizontal and apply across design efforts, from phones to programming languages.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As long as you keep on feeding the machine by buying their products and accepting whatever flaws they have - you might complain a bit but you still buy the next version - you&#039;re just confirming their policy of &quot;change for change&#039;s sake&quot; and the accompanying planned obsolescence by making older hardware slow to a crawl.

The solution is simple: stop buying defective products. If a phone makes you sick it is defective for you, no matter how much you might prefer to have a device with a specific logo on the back. Get another phone, one without that logo. Don&#039;t expect others to follow you, brand loyalty is a strong force comparable to religious zeal. Just accept that the brand has taken itself out of your sphere of acceptable behaviour and let it go. Maybe they&#039;ll get the message, maybe not. For you the future lies elsewhere.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Herb. I have always been a fan of &quot;Function Over Form&quot;. Think the HP voyager series RPN calculators. Aesthetics should remain a secondary concern, and not to the detriment of functionality. Apple has always done a great job when it comes to software quality regarding resource management (CPU and RAM). So it is puzzling why they have not extended this practice to the GPU as well.

					<description><![CDATA[I have no suggestion for you, but I share your disdain for the current offering.  It seems that every iOS rev introduces a slew of change just for the sake of change.  I&#039;ve had parallax turned off since day 1 (like you).  I find the new lock screen temperamental, and the choice of large fonts reduces available space to present information on my preferred screen size--that of the 5S/SE.

Back in the days of NeXT, Steve Jobs used to make developers use the least capable machine supported by the target product on which they worked.  This kept developers &quot;honest&quot; and attentive to performance issues and hardware constraints.  I think Apple could benefit from doing the same thing with iOS developers.]]></description>
