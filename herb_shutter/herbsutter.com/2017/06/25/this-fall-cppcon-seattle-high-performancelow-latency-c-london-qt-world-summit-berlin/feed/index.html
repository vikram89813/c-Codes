					<description><![CDATA[@Bender: Right now most of my C++ writing output is going into the C++ Core Guideilnes (https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines) and standards design proposals (e.g., Consistent comparison, https://wg21.link/p0515). Re C++ AMP: We contributed major parts of that for standardization and the &quot;Parallel STL&quot; that is now part of C++17 is a direct evolution of several of those parts (of C++ AMP and Thrust), including being designed around parallel/vector versions of nearly all the existing STL algorithms.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[QT is great for middle layer C++ guys, like there is something in C++ that will make you think about learning some other language too...
Howcever, it should be standardized and ... well, I hope it will not have same destiniy like Borland, due to the fact that they had something that could work on Linux as well....]]></description>
