					<description><![CDATA[First, thanks for your interest in the book, and sorry that you&#039;re having this experience.

I did not write that book (yet) but Amazon has listed it for years. The publisher tried to get them to take it down but that seems impossible for some inscrutable publishing reason. They definitely should not be taking your money for a book that does not exist, please ask them for a refund.

[Disclaimer: I have not ruled out actually writing the book. Who knows, it might even be in the next year or two if I have time. But even if I do write it, it&#039;s virtually certain that it would end up being under a different ISBN number, so either way the current ISBN entry in the bookstore should be deleted by Amazon if only they can figure out how to do that.]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In the range-based-for example, &quot;for (auto&#038; x : f().items())&quot; is perfectly valid if items() returns a prvalue or a glvalue whose lifetime is not tied to the lifetime of the return value of f. The UB case is when f returns a prvalue and items returns a reference to or view over a member container of f&#039;s return value. You can argue that the example is dangerous since it&#039;s not clear *what* f returns, but it would more clearly illustrate the problem and the value of the new feature if &quot;f().items()&quot; was something like &quot;vector&#060;vector&#062;{{1,2,3}}[0]&quot;.]]></description>

I didn’t make it to Seattle, because I had to shorten my trip to make room for a trip to England, but I plan to make it next year.
