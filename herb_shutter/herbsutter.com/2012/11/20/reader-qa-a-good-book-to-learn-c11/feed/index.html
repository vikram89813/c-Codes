					<description><![CDATA[Well, you won&#039;t find a more comprehensive and peer reviewed list of C++ books than http://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list. Just search for &quot;C++11&quot; for books covering C++11.

Anyways, on the topic of C++ books, I just wanted to say it would be very great if someone out there could write a comprehensive modern book about IOStreams, Locales and perhaps Encodings. While the outdated &quot;The C++ IO Streams and Locales&quot; by Angelika Langer and Klaus Kreft is a great book and still has merit, there is just *not* enough information out there on these topics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just wanted to second the recommendation for C++ Primer 5e. As others have pointed out, it is lengthy, and if you are a already an experienced C++ developer, there are likely better options. However, if you&#039;re just diving into the language, or haven&#039;t used C++ for a while, C++ Primer is an excellent read. I found it very well written and clear. The code samples act as a reference for good, modern C++ style.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The ETA really depends heavily on when I have a solid month to update and collect the articles. I have enough material (search for &quot;Effective Concurrency&quot; on this site for pointers to the DDJ articles -- there&#039;s enough for a book) and I have to update/C++11-ify them and put them in book form.

I get the same question about Exceptional C++(11) -- ditto except I have to actually update the GotWs and write new ones, which I started in the spring and summer before being completely swamped with isocpp.org and the Foundation instead.]]></description>

As you noted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://herbsutter.com/2011/11/01/scott-meyerss-c11-materials-the-best-available-overview-of-c11/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;your review of them&lt;/a&gt;, they&#039;re not a book, but they&#039;re available immediately, they&#039;re a lot shorter than comprehensive C++11 books are or are likely to be (364 pages versus around 1000), and buyers receive updates to the notes when I make them. (Since their original publication in 2010, they&#039;ve been updated five times.)  I encourage people to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artima.com/samples/cpp11NotesSample.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;free sample&lt;/a&gt; so they can judge for themselves whether this is something they would find useful in moving from C++98/03 to C++11.
