					<description><![CDATA[@ various: I was leaving aside some of the higher-end parts (CPUs, GPUs) in part to be conservative and not overestimate. We&#039;ve got plenty of parallelism, and as I mentioned in Welcome to the Jungle the problem is that it&#039;s coming in forms that are increasingly difficult to program in order to extract actual speedups... single-thread was one thing, multi-core parallel was harder, vectorization is harder, and heterogeneous (GPU) is harder again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The number of GPU threads do not represent the raw processing power of the chip since most of them are idle to hide memory latencies - so it&#039;s apples to oranges comparison with CPU HW threads. It&#039;s more relevant to compare the number of CU&#039;s on a GPU multiplied with the warp size, which is in hundreds range.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As I&#039;m sure you know, you are somewhat undercounting GPU parallelism.  It&#039;s not unreasonable to hand a Kepler GTX 680 a grid of 2500-8000 threads in order to highly utilize the device.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shawn: &quot;mainstream.&quot;  (X86 have been more or less dead since 2006. &#060;-- ... what?  Please be serious.)

Mr. Sutter: AMD is at 16 cores in customer-facing parts on Best Buy shelves as of a little over a year ago; 16-core Bulldozers are currently $630, or $450 at wholesale.  (They aren&#039;t price competitive, since Intel has gotten so far ahead, but your prediction still came true ahead of time.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What about Sun Niagara/ SPARC T3/4/5 processors? 16 core with 8 threads per core. That is some fun stuff. 
X86 have been more or less dead since 2006. Since Intel don&#039;t have any competition, they have not improved their CPUs as much. Between 2006 to 2012 intel have doubled its speed on desktop. From 2007 to 2012 ARM have managed to speed up its SoC/CPU 17 times. 
Apple A6 is as fast per mhz as intel today. That is amazing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was optimistic about multicore development in 2006 but I&#039;ve gotten more pessimistic since then.

For one thing,  the software problem is tough,  and the real problem is Amdahl&#039;s law.  I built a system that has ten processing stages;  seven of those stages parallelize well,  two max out around 2-3 cores,  and the last is serial.  If I went from 4 to 12 cores I might get a last doubling of speed,  but improvements would be small from there on out.

I also used to ignore the effects of the memory hierarchy.  Take AMD&#039;s Fusion,  which I was impressed with at first.  From a programmer&#039;s perspective the unified memory architecture is great,  but it really means Fusion will always be a low end part because you don&#039;t get GPU performance without GPU memory and with GPU memory you won&#039;t get good performance for CPU workloads.

Memory hierarchy also made the IBM/Sony &quot;Cell&quot; processor a disappointment.

It&#039;s getting really boring to read about hardware on sites like ArsTechnica because there just isn&#039;t any news anymore.  Back in the 2000s there were real performance improvements either in clock rate or IPC or number of cores.  Today it&#039;s just some fantasyland about how they busted their tail to reduce power consumption by 100 times in theory except there is something FUBAR about the software and it doesn&#039;t really work cause the thing is going to switch on and never switch off and get hot and burn out your battery in 20 minutes.]]></description>
