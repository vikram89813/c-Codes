					<description><![CDATA[I am really excited about C++11 but I wished someone had thought of adding new operators.

Specifically, I wish we had &#124; as unary operator, as in
  double x = -0.4;
  double y = &#124; x &#124;;

and &#124;&#124; also (why not) as in: x = &#124;&#124; w &#124;&#124;

With scalar basic types, naturally, &#124;x&#124; would be a synonym of abs / fabs / labs.
Standard libraries and user defined classes could overload these operators to do neat things, 
like for example 
&#124;&#124; v &#124;&#124; being the size (number of elements) of container v, e.g. when v is a std::vector.

In a 3D vector library, &#124;x&#124; would stand for the norm of 3D vector x, and so on. 
 
I don&#039;t think if would be difficult to parse that and disambiguate with the binary I and II operators.

Sure, it would not have been a revolutionary change; syntactic sugar if you will, but a sweet one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really dont get gcalloc lock-free connection, if somebody can link me to expanded explanation for noobs it would be nice...  other than that nice session, but a bit to short... I mean ppl get a chance to grill :P Herb 1 or 2 times/year at least make it last. :)]]></description>
