					<description><![CDATA[I have to agree with the several comments criticizing touchscreens for their lack of tactile feedback.  Perhaps I&#039;m biased.  I have worked in a few industries (aviation, naval ship control) that have convinced me touchscreens are a compromise (albiet a very good one).  When working with the same device, doing the same thing over and over, when your attention should be devoted elsewhere, you don&#039;t want to have to look at your finger to see where it is going.  You want to be able to reach the control (button, knob, etc.), positively identify it, and manipulate it.  You don&#039;t look at the grip on your hammer while you&#039;re driving a nail, do you?

Phones and tablets are perfect candidates for touchscreens for a couple of reasons. One, the real-estate is limited so doubling up the usefulness is a big plus.  But the major reason touchscreens work is that these are general purpose devices -- they can be programmed to do anything.  But if you were running the same app, day in and day out (such as, I don&#039;t know, dialing a phone), a dedicated key pad would win any day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well said. Indeed it is another exciting new era.

I was fortunate as a teenager to spend my 1974 college vacation working at an IBM research centre on algorithmic optimizations and visualizations. Mainframe with full screen editing terminals were hi-tech interactivity compared to the punched card and paper tape machines still commonplace in that era. One or two of us would stay back into the evening with the mainframe to ourselves madeking for my first personal computer experience right down to crashing and rebooting (IPL) the IBM 370 from front panel. 2Mb main memory was massive back then (when not shared among 30+ users). Returning for a spell 3 years later on a graphics and visualisation project, it was disappointing to find the mainframe room locked down but by then we had more memory, fancier terminals, trackballs, and fewer crashes. The Z80 and 6502 had arrived by then so personal computing not a total washout though small beer compared to using a mainframe PC. It took about 15 years to turn that 1974 vision into a flexible low cost personal computer with comaprable performance. Your &#039;Phase 2&#039;. Indeed it was exciting to be a part of making all that unfold. User interaction was the key driver through that era as you point out.

If 15 years seems like a long time, I&#039;ll mention gesture input. A 1987 visit to a graphics chip manufacturer, spotted a camera linked to a PC in reception. By the time the guy I was meeting had arrived i&#039;d convinced myself &#039;gesture input&#039; was the next big thing. Back to base despite using every memory saving trick in the book and writing masses of assembler I didn&#039;t get much further than a jerky point and click mouse emulation so convinced myself we needed a fair few years of Moores law and set it to one side. Although certainly didn&#039;t expect to wait 25 years before programming the first low cost commercial device!

So for me touch, speech and gesture have been around forever, waiting for the silicon curve to catch up. And it finally has. I&#039;m 100% with you on your &#039;four predictions&#039;. Indeed it makes for an exciting time for those of us who recall &#039;Wave 1&#039; through to those like my 14 year old son who can look forward to being a part of Wave 4.

And yes, thats all about UI too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I keep seeing this trend people a pushing and, while I *like* it for some uses (phones, casual browsing, low bandwidth interactions like reading blogs and channel surfing), I don&#039;t see it for anything of substance. Are people really going to sit there and work a 24&quot; touchscreen for 8 hours? Or how about sit around the office talking over your co-workers? Heck, my arms get tired just thinking about using a gesture interface as part of my work. I just don&#039;t see it scaling.

Now I don&#039;t think they are a passing fad, but if someone thinks that they will replace the keyboard/mouse as a *primary* interface for *all* uses, then I think that they will have abdicated a significant market segment to whoever wished to step into the gap.

The annoying thing here is that I strongly suspect that a good keyboard/mouse UI and a good touch UI are mutually exclusive. Trying to write a desktop manager or app that is good at both will fail at at least one, and possibly both.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[love the insight about kids growing up with voice commands for the x-box thinking anything without voice commands would be &quot;broken&quot;. it makes me think about all the times I&#039;ve been frustrated with a product for not being able to do what I felt it should be able to, since everything else like it can, and feeling like it was broken and just saying &quot;well next time I&#039;ll just buy from the competitor instead&quot;. 

This really could have farther reaching consequences into the industry than I thought before, giants could fall, and usurper could come out of nowhere. Things could look really different in a few years. That is exciting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Am I the only one not convinced that the touch screen revolution is going to happen or be good if it does in a major way? I think &quot;touch&quot; or gesture in a lesser way may catch on and be useful if done properly but any major push (excuse the pun) in this way will simply lead to massive RSI problems and lawsuits. There is probably a significant amount of research still needed into the area ot reduce that. I myself will be not be looking to use touch too much because of this and it&#039;s why I&#039;m keen for mouse and keyboard to remain popular until there are more advances in other devices that reduce RSI, not increase it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loathe touchscreens.  They have zero tactile feedback.  They require the screen to be within an arm&#039;s length.  They smudge the beautiful text and graphics with oily fingerprints.  Sometimes your touch is recognized, but sometimes it isn&#039;t. And you can never tell if the screen missed your touch, or if the device is just being sluggish and unresponsive.  Touchscreens are the worst thing for ergonomics since the laptop.  (Remember how revolutionary the detached keyboard was?)  With a touchscreen, you need the visual feedback because there is no tactile feedback.  You can close your eyes and type on a physical keyboard and know when you&#039;ve made a typo by feel.  With a touchscreen all you have is the visual feedback, but it always seems your hand is in the way of that feedback.  Touchscreens are a step backwards for accessibility.  I honestly don&#039;t get the slate/smartphone craze.  I find the devices entirely unintuitive, unsatisfying, and usable.

I&#039;m sure you&#039;re right about touchscreens becoming the dominant form in a very short time.  For me, though, that&#039;s a huge negative.  As a software engineer, I&#039;m not excited; I&#039;m hugely disappointed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good insight. Holographic UIs that are projected from any mobile device is where we are headed IMHO which sort of moves touch out of the picture (pun intended). Whatever the device, whatever the visual representation, still needs some way to build these UIs into a useful and meaningful UX. Human interaction via touch, speech and/or gestures is not only the beginning, its starting to get old. As Tom Brander states above AI is important if that is coupled with &quot;Speech understanding&quot;. To be able to &quot;listen&quot; to a conversation and actually understand the semantics as opposed to recognizing the syntactic elements of what is being talked about, then act on that in a non-annoying and accurate way will be the way we interact with knowledge and entertainment &quot;UIs&quot; in the future.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Brian: I was skeptical of big TV-sized touchscreens until the first time I touched one. Once you touch a screen, any screen, there&#039;s no going back. If TVs were touchable, we wouldn&#039;t use that capability to change channels -- we&#039;d use that big screen to do more new things like interactive games, anything you could do with a big electronic whiteboard on steroids, and lots more we can&#039;t imagine yet.

For an example, I did a Q&#038;A session on Channel 9 after my talk yesterday (it should air soon) where there was an 80&quot; touchscreen behind us, and it was incredibly useful simply to bring up the isocpp.org site and answer questions by just walking over and touching and pinch-zooming around the site super easily, way faster than with a keyboard and mouse, huge and easy to show, and very interactive.

Honest, no screen should be without touch. Once you try touch you&#039;ll never want to go back. And you&#039;ll leave fingerprints all over old non-touch screens... really, everyone I know has made that mistake many times already. You&#039;ll be seeing lots more fingerprints on Macbooks... :)]]></description>
