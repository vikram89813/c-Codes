					<description><![CDATA[@Glen: Thanks, that&#039;s very helpful. I hadn&#039;t run across it because I follow the Forums via email only. This is annoying to me too (now) because it gives the impression that isocpp.org is crashing your browser whereas it&#039;s actually the third-party Google Groups as used within an iframe (to keep the site&#039;s chrome and make it look more integrated) that seems to be what&#039;s really failing.

As we evaluate using Google Apps/Groups vs. Mailman for the committee&#039;s own use and for isocpp.org, I think you&#039;ve identified two important things that appear to weigh in Mailman&#039;s favor:

1. Multiple/third-party logins: I think it&#039;s important that no login at all is needed to read any part of isocpp.org, and that just one login into isocpp.org is sufficient to do anything else including posting comments. And, as you&#039;ve already pointed out, Google requires a third-party Google login which isn&#039;t great. If we do stick with Groups (and for now in the interim while we&#039;re using it), I&#039;m inclined to drop the iframes entirely and link to it as a third-party separate service to set expectations that it really is third-party and hopefully mitigate confusion. I&#039;ll look into that this week.

2. Integration with isocpp.org: But I also think it&#039;s desirable to be able to correctly embed the forum browse-and-search within isocpp.org itself. After all, why not host the forums as part of the site given that we are running them ourselves? As you&#039;ve shown, Groups doesn&#039;t seem to support this well, and works better as a standalone service..

These will probably weigh in favor of Mailman as we continue to test out Groups and Mailman to see which is the right technology to run with for the committee and the site. Having said that, these aren&#039;t the only criteria and Groups may end up being better overall, but they&#039;re two fairly big hurdles to overcome that I don&#039;t think these particular items are issues with Mailman.

Thanks again. I really appreciate this helpful feedback and the specific repro.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb

One very topical sequence that seems the most repeatable to me is this one:

If i sign in, then go to proposals, then scroll down the list of peoples topics/suggestions, then click the (irritatingly named) &quot;sign in to reply&quot; button, it takes me to google&#039;s sign in page. If I then hit &quot;back&quot; (since infact I have already signed in, just not using google) i.e. 9 crashes, a good 50% of the time. It&#039;s probably true that the site crashes every 5-10 minutes. in general for me, which I would wonder if it&#039;s just my machine except this doesn&#039;t happen on any other site at all.

I have all the latest patches for i.e. and windows 7 installed.

I&#039;ve been tempted to try again with ie.10 and the latest platform update preview (or even just the preview on it&#039;s own), but being a preview, I haven&#039;t had the courage in case things get worse not better. (Curious to know if anyone e;se rates the windows 7 sp1 platform update preview as safe?).

I think the site is great, but I do think it&#039;s a pretty big fail, and a 100% fail for me, that the site advertises that you can post topics and reply if you register but then fails to mention you have to have a google account to really do it, but despite that, it will happily accept a non google account when you sign up, and furthermore, it appears you can&#039;t change your email address either? Not to mention the crashes.

Sorry in advance if I have missed an option/link here means any of this is untrue, but otherwise whichever of these facts is true, it should be on the front page. Otherwise, it&#039;s quite the email harvester/generator and irritant for me right now and I wouldn&#039;t have registered if I&#039;d known this was the deal.

If I find any kind of crash trace with more useful information for you, I&#039;ll let you know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@glen: I&#039;d love to know more about the crashes -- we tried many browser/OS configurations across PCs/laptops/tablets/phones, including that one, and I haven&#039;t seen any. If you have a repro (e.g., it crashes X% of the time when I do Y then Z) please let me know.

The main isocpp.org site is fully browseable without a login, and registering for a login is optional (it enables things like commenting) and free. However, the forums are actually currently separate and hosted by Google Apps/Groups as an interim test. We (the committee) are in the process of replacing our aging hand-written email lists, and are trying out Google Groups and Mailman; this is a test of the former. Groups has the disadvantage that it seems to want this extra login, which although free is still a Google login and several people have said they don&#039;t like the second login. That&#039;s one of the tradeoffs we&#039;re going to discuss, and we&#039;ll take it into consideration when choosing between Groups and Mailman in the coming months.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Herb

The isocpp.org website is great (though it crashes the browser completely all the time on windows 7 64 bit and ie 9 with all the latest patches).

What I don&#039;t understand is why after registering with it, it then appears to require a gmail account to use the forums plus whatever email account you use to sign up with. Nowhere on the site does it say it requires two email accounts. Can you explain if that is infact the case please or can you use the forums with just one account, and can it be a hotmail account? In general, &#039;m getting quite fed up with sites insisting on so much information for everything even programming discussions. Windows 8 appears to be going the same way.

Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Vegard: Herb cannot really speak on behalf of the gcc team (his talk was in a double role, one representing the VC++ team at MS, one as part of the ISO standardization team).
