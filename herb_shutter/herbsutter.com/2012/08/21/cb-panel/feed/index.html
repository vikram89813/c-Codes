					<description><![CDATA[With regards to static loops, the reason I think these are necessary is variadic parameter packs.

					<description><![CDATA[I was interested in your comments around additions to the standard C++ library, particularly around XML where you mentioned Xerces by name. Given that Xerces implements, amongst other things like SAX, the standard DOM C++ binding I was wondering about your views on this. This binding, presumably because of it&#039;s cross language IDL roots, does not really use much of the rest of the standard C++ library, not even std::string. Would a C++ interface such as this, which is a very well defined and documented standard, be rejected by the C++ standards committee because it doesn&#039;t use other portions of the standard where appropriate or is this not a problem?
I ask as I&#039;m not aware of any broadly used C++ XML library that does use the rest of the standard library, certainly not C++11 and would therefore assume that any standardization with C++ would be many years off. 
Also has there been any talk between the C++ committee and W3C on this?]]></description>
