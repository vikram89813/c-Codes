					<description><![CDATA[XP support should be dropped only when XP is fully phased out (which, if I understand correctly is due in 2014). Until customers aren&#039;t forced to upgrade, they won&#039;t. They see it as unnecessary cost, and frankly, they are right. They will still demand XP support for the applications until they aren&#039;t forced to update. 

I agree with phasing out XP, but I don&#039;t agree with the order it is happening: first the OS, then the dev tools, not the other way around.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Alfonse, after approving your comment:

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Re Windows XP support, I can’t comment on XP support for this release beyond what’s been said, but I can point you to where to file Beta feedback on this specifically: http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/690617. This (or other Connect bugs you may open on this or other topics) will definitely be considered side-by-side with the other Connect bugs and their relative customer rankings as we try to prioritize the ones people vote highest and comment on most with specific data.&quot;

This is a bold-face lie. This bug was closed as &quot;as designed.&quot; It will not &quot;definitely be considered side-by-side&quot; with *anything*. The decision has already been made, and further feedback will be irrelevant. The bug is closed, Microsoft had already decided, end of story.

I really don&#039;t know why you want to lie to us Herb. Just say it: VC2011 will not support XP, no matter how many people it impacts or who complains about it. Say the words. That&#039;s what Microsoft is doing. Stop blowing smoke at people and tell the *truth*.

I have to say that it&#039;s very disappointing that you would lie to the community so brazenly. Bad form, Herb, bad form.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am also impressed :). Beta compiles LLVM and Clang 3.0 like a breeze (except for some portions in the optional toolchain, possibly requiring variadic templates when looking at the error messages; but these are not important for the LLVM/Clang core)... And also quite fast! For me this indicates that even the beta compiler is already quite solid and doesn&#039;t choke himself on advanced code bases. The new look of VS 11 is ok. I maybe even like it more, since it got rid of all the color based distractions. Most importantly for me were the new C++ languages features though. I hope VC++ will have full support within the next one or maybe two years! Maybe you could also think of some &quot;auto update&quot; of the compiler, so that it simply notifies us when new features are available and on command, adds a new toolset to VS? The old toolset should still be selectable, since all those beta compilers will sure break some code... Keep on the good work and don&#039;t listen to all those dumb asses who write &quot;pathetic&quot; or similar things to the new release [on msdn sites and stuff, now here].]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Herb: &#062; I no longer like Option 3 very well [...] because it’s really hard to write correct code. I will update this article to have [...] cancellation_token
I understand these concerns, however I am convinced we could do better than providing *no* interruption support in std::thread. Or has it been a strategic decision to not include it, until it becomes clear what the best solution is? The idea with &quot;cancellation_token&quot;, which is essentially a stripped down version of boost::thread interruption, solves only half of the problem. For short-running threads it is okay to poll for cancellation. However for long-running background threads which are in a wait call, waiting on a condition (=for more work), I cannot poll at the same time. What I need here is exactly the boost interruption model which aborts/throws an exception during condition wait. 
The fundamental problem with boost::thread interruption comes down to writing exception safe code. I&#039;m not sure whether it&#039;s a good idea to cater for all the non-exception safe code. Maybe if the code isn&#039;t exception safe one shouldn&#039;t mess with threading at all, which is an even more difficult topic.
Nevertheless why not explicitly ask the user what he wants? C++11 lambdas made an excellent choice of not providing any default capture variant, since neither &quot;=&quot; nor &quot;&#038;&quot; is superior in general. Concerning the question whether interruption should be allowed to happen during &quot;condition wait&quot; we have the same situation. How this looks syntactially doesn&#039;t matter that much (be it a new function &quot;condition_variable::wait_interruptible&quot; or a new bool flag &quot;interruptible&quot;). While the user defines the interruption behavior, he thinks actively about the impact of exceptions in the current context. This is in fact cooperation without polling.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>@Herb: &gt; I no longer like Option 3 very well [&#8230;] because it’s really hard to write correct code. I will update this article to have [&#8230;] cancellation_token<br />
I understand these concerns, however I am convinced we could do better than providing *no* interruption support in std::thread. Or has it been a strategic decision to not include it, until it becomes clear what the best solution is? The idea with &#8220;cancellation_token&#8221;, which is essentially a stripped down version of boost::thread interruption, solves only half of the problem. For short-running threads it is okay to poll for cancellation. However for long-running background threads which are in a wait call, waiting on a condition (=for more work), I cannot poll at the same time. What I need here is exactly the boost interruption model which aborts/throws an exception during condition wait.<br />

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;before we pull the trigger to do this at the expense of delaying other work, how does item rank compared to, say, getting more C++11 features six months sooner if we didn’t do something about this issue?’&quot;

It doesn&#039;t matter when the new C++11 features get added if we can&#039;t use them in production code because it would mean that a significant number of our customers can&#039;t use it. I have both voted and commented on that report.

As I understand it, the binaries that compiler produces supports the OS, but the MFC and CRT libraries simply use static linking instead of dynamic linking for functions which are specific to Vista and later.  Is that an accurate statement, or is there more to it than that?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Re Windows XP support, I can&#039;t comment on XP support for this release beyond what&#039;s been said, but I can point you to where to file Beta feedback on this specifically: http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/690617. This (or other Connect bugs you may open on this or other topics) will definitely be considered side-by-side with the other Connect bugs and their relative customer rankings as we try to prioritize the ones people vote highest and comment on most with specific data.

If you care about this or any other bug/concern, the best thing you can do is upvote the relevant item and add specific comments -- note that even brief specific data about how/why a particular issue affects you always helps more with prioritization than a one-line data-free flame. If enough people upvote and comment on any given Connect bug/request, that bug will get considered; we do watch and listen to Connect bugs. Note that if we do maybe spend more time on a given Connect bug/request (such as XP support, or anything else), it&#039;ll always be at the expense of doing other things more slowly, so if this turns out to be a huge issue then one of my follow-up questions later on might be a poll like, &#039;okay, but before we pull the trigger to do this at the expense of delaying other work, how does item rank compared to, say, getting more C++11 features six months sooner if we didn&#039;t do something about this issue?&#039; -- there are only so many dev and QA hours so it&#039;s always a question of priority compared to other desirable features.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@zhnmjo123: For interruption, see my article &quot;Interrupt Politely&quot; at http://drdobbs.com/parallel/207100682 .

One update: I no longer like Option 3 very well as described in that article, because it&#039;s really hard to write correct code in practice using Java/.NET style thread interruption because exceptions can be thrown from things like mutex::lock and people just can&#039;t/don&#039;t write correct code in the face of that even when they know about it (example: the .NET Frameworks themselves are not interruption-safe, making the feature essentially unusable in practice). For the book (which I hope to finally write this summer) I will update this article to have Option &quot;3.5&quot; or something refer to the newest best practice (not implemented in Boost&#039;s version) which is cancellation tokens such as cancellation_token in PPL (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/hh781020.aspx). That&#039;s something people can actually code against because it&#039;s not done &quot;to&quot; them, it&#039;s more co-operative.

And of course Option 4 is a perennial favorite, enables clear and correct code and really isn&#039;t more complex: write the cooperative interruption code yourself (e.g., check an atomic flag).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Herb: &#062; in VC++ you will now be able to use plain std::thread (and std::atomic, etc.).
I understand that std::thread has no means of interruption like boost::thread::interrupt. What is your suggestion how to deal with this problem in practice?

Currently I see only two solutions:
1. Implement a custom interrupt mechanism in each case. This is quite bad with regards to code redundancy. Also a simple &quot;flag&quot; solution doesn&#039;t perform well if the thread is sleeping, or waiting on a condition.
2. Anthony Williams suggest to build an &quot;interruptable thread&quot; oneself based on std::thread. Although this is annoying to some degree, because this should be in std::thread already, I&#039;m willing to go this route, if necessary.

PS: A remark for one of your next books/articles: Almost all examples on how to use std::thread on the net are not exception safe (as Andrei Alexandrescu also noted), since they reference a local variable somewhere, but are not joined in case of exceptions. If someone can show a shiny ideomatic and correct usage of std::thread, it would be you ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Herb,

Any chance of a comment on the situation that executables produced using VS11 wont run on XP? Like many others we have a large number of customers still on XP so I can&#039;t simply choose to not support that OS.

As I see it this decision by Microsoft will mean that adoption of new C++11 features and libraries will be slower than it should be which I think you will agree is a less than ideal situation.

I don&#039;t hold out much hope of a change of policy by Microsoft given this comment by Pat Brenner.

&quot;This behavior is by design in MFC and CRT for Visual Studio vNext. The minimum supported operating systems are Windows Server 2008 SP2 and Windows Vista. Windows XP is not a supported operating system for the release (design-time or run-time).
