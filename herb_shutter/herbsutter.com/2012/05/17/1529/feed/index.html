					<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to post a retraction. Despite the hysteria (understandable given the messaging from MSFT), it IS possible to write a desktop application in C++ using the compiler shipping with Visual Studio Express 2012. I just got it to work.  Of course you can&#039;t do it with the IDE, but the command line is there. And you have to install the Windows SDK separately. But it can be done. The raw tools are there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to pile-on or hijack the thread. Let&#039;s face,these sorts of decisions come from elsewhere. Just wanted to register my dismay. I&#039;m sure we&#039;re all aware of the many sound arguments for making fully functional command line tools (note that I did not say IDE) available at no extra charge above and beyond what we pay for the OS.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Herb, and just today I got further confirmation of your viewpoint.

Pete Brown said this about his changing position at MS - &quot;I will also continue working with the Silverlight and WPF community, but will add to that a much larger focus on Windows 8 XAML going forward, and possibly some phone work too.&quot;

This is evidence that XAML is something important to MS.

See Pete&#039;s announcement here - http://10rem.net/blog/2012/05/22/my-new-role-at-microsoft

Thanks for your response.]]></description>
