					<description><![CDATA[So although you appear at every MS conference streamed on C9(+ other videos) and repeat always the same stuff nobody from MS doesnt mind that you keep the cool stuff for your conf? :/  Meh, at least I hope they wont schedule you any more to give another HW Jungle/ not your grandmas C++ PR talk. My hope is that Charles digs up some &quot;Concurrency STL&quot; from ms dev team :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Mr Anonymous

Thanks for your kindly reply.

Could I consider the situation as: &quot;There still would be a Visual C++ 11 Express, which is able to create Metro project only.&quot; ?

After all, something is better than nothing. C++11 + WinRT is an acceptable regression : (

Thank you very much : )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@sunseraphic: I believe the full compiler toolchain is still available in Visual Studio 11 Express.

					<description><![CDATA[Herb, Sounds like a very interesting set of talks and ones that do require discussion, however another more pressing issue of concern more so than the use of parallelism in C++, is whether or not someone from a less well off environment (financially), will be able to compile a cli &#039;hello world&#039; program using future versions of visual studio express - sort of a msvc 11 and beyond?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Herb

There are a lot of rumors on the internet that Microsoft would provide neither Visual C++ 11 Express nor Visual C++ command-line tools in Windows SDK.

It implies that who want to enjoy the C++11 features by using Visual C++ must pay hundreds of dollars to have a complete Visual Studio Suite.

May you confirm this or give some comments, please?

Sorry for post a question has nothing about the article.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot; P.S.: I haven’t seen this much attention and investment in C++ since last century –C++ conferences at record numbers, C++ compiler investments by the biggest companies in the industry (e.g., Clang), and much more that we’ve seen already&quot;

Indeed. This makes Microsoft&#039;s decision to drop XP support in VS11 and, worse, get rid of Visual C++ Express that much worse. I suspect that the younger generatiom has for years used VC++ Express to start their C++ journey creating console applications. Now they&#039;ll be stuck on VC++ Express 2010 with its (very) limited C++11 support for the years to come.

Sad, but I guess $$$ and fear for Apple are more important...]]></description>
