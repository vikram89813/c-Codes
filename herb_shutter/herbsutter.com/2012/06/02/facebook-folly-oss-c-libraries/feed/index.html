There is a vc11 solution with a simple quick and dirty testing of some stuff mainly format

Format, Conversion, fbstring, dynamic, json, at least compile and execute some simple code

Take a look at it]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I&#039;m Tudor. I initiated the folly project at Facebook (and I&#039;m responsible for the name) and I&#039;m one of the main contributors.

Folly was released with an ultimate goal in mind -- to make it easier for Facebook to release more, higher-level software written in C++. We also hope it will be useful to other people in its own right, and we&#039;ve made sure that the code is high quality (that&#039;s not to say it&#039;s bug-free, of course; we&#039;d welcome bug reports).

We do use Linux x86_64 exclusively, and portability has never been a main concern; architecture- and OS-specific optimizations are absolutely worth doing at Facebook&#039;s scale.  We liberally use C++11 features that VC++ doesn&#039;t support (variadic templates), we rely on Linux- and gcc-specific library functions, and we make use of optimizations that wouldn&#039;t even make sense on a 32-bit platform (stuffing extra data, including a mutex, inside the 64 bits of a pointer, relying on the fact that at most 48 of those bits are actually used).

As far as distributions go, we use a heavily customized version of CentOS internally (doesn&#039;t this always happen in large-scale deployments?) and an internally developed build system -- all the autoconf stuff and testing the build on various distributions happened for the purpose of open-sourcing this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Google has released its version of these common shared libraries as part of Chrome (to answer Tom&#039;s question)
http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/base/
Some of this is the same as what&#039;s used on the server side, a lot of it is different. This is a standalone-able library of Chrome that is used in many Google client programs, ChromeOS, etc.

It doesn&#039;t use C++11 which is either an advantage or a disadvantage depending on your development. To answer Lars&#039; question, &quot;base&quot; runs on Windows, Linux, OSX, Android, and various (at least at one time or another) BSDs.

It&#039;s got quite a lot more stuff than Folly, most notably for platform independence, but less &quot;here&#039;s a more optimized version of vector&quot; stuff than Folly. If you&#039;re building a client C++ app, I think the platform-independent message loop processing is the most valuable and complicated part since it&#039;s been tuned for a large high-performance app (Chrome).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Too bad Microsoft is trying to force Metro down everybody&#039;s throat.  The decision to remove Win32 application support from Visual Studio Express 2012 is a slap in the face to the open source community.  I don&#039;t know any open source developers who want to be locked in to Metro.  Any developer who wants to use C++11 features on Windows either has to pay $500 for Visual Studio 2012 Professional or use gcc.

Herb, I understand you aren&#039;t personally responsible for every decision of your employer.  Maybe you agree with what they&#039;ve done with VS 2012, maybe you don&#039;t.  If you don&#039;t, it wouldn&#039;t be appropriate for you to air that disagreement in public.  Having said that, it&#039;s hard to take you seriously when you talk about open source C++11 libraries while you employer is erecting financial barriers to C++11 adoption by Windows developers.

A word of caution, though ... now that the C++ general-purpose library fragmentation is uncovered, we&#039;ll see how massive C++ wheel reinvention actually is. Which, again, can be a Good Thing if handled right; forces should be synergistically joined to standardize a combination of the best code out there, both performance- and design-wise. Hopefully, more standard proposal pressure will ensue on a wider frontline and we will actually see competing proposals; it is of utmost importance to funnel those into a coherent and well designed standard framework.

I have to admit - I got intrigued by the act of folly; so much so that I&#039;m getting ready to benchmark Poco::Dynamic::Var against folly::dynamic ;-). Stay tuned ...]]></description>
