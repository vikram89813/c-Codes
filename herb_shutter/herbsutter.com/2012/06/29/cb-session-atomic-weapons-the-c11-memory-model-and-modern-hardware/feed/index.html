					<description><![CDATA[Oh nevermind... 
Memory model: N2429 made the Core Language recognize the existence of multithreading, but there appears to be nothing for a compiler implementation to do (at least, one that already supported multithreading).  So it&#039;s N/A in the table.
I dont get why clang and gcc have it as NO, under implemented. I guess somebody is understanding something wrong, or it is just a matter of labeling.]]></description>

Memory model 	N/A 	N/A
What does that mean, I mean if VS doesnt support memory model( AFAIK Clang, gcc also dont) what is the point of the talk.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For Concerned C++ Programmer:

Having attended the encore session of this in 2010, it is well worth the $3000. I agree that it is expensive, but it is not your usual conference either. If you want to go the cheap route, purchase the standard from the ISO, or check out one of the more recent draft standards (which are free). If you want an expert to explain the intricacies, then expect to pay for it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Herb, A $3000+ USD cost in this financial climate for a 2 day course is not justifiable for the overwhelming majority of people.

Could you kindly upload a video of the talk or at the very least provide the slides on-line for free?]]></description>
