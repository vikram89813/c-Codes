					<description><![CDATA[Also, I&#039;m very glad to see the standards committee is willing to drop a C++14 as a kind of bug-fix release, to more quickly standardize things like polymorphic lambdas and so forth. It&#039;d also be nice to see some of the smaller library proposals get into this, like N3398 (for string conversions between unicode encodings) and maybe ranges.

Oh, and I&#039;m surprised (and pleased) to see a range working group. I&#039;m not sure why you need a working group to say, &quot;Do what Boost does,&quot; but maybe they can one-up Boost and do it better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm so much hype! It better be good! I can&#039;t deny it&#039;s a little exciting though!

Hard to know what headlines to wish for! But since I&#039;m wishing, but not expecting - If I worked at MS, I&#039;d announce this:

&quot;Microsoft announces update to &quot;common sense&quot; to 2.0. (sorry!, had to say it)
&quot;Microsoft makes app store permanently free or of a nominal charge for all app types&quot;.
&quot;Microsoft announces no more C++/CX, ever&quot;.

I know we don&#039;t even have C++11 from MS (I expect some announcements there to say the least),
but since I&#039;m wishing anyway, I&#039;d also say:

&quot;Microsoft invites gcc and clang developers to Build. Collectively, they all announce reference implementations in in gcc, clang and vs2012 of the following C++1y features, to get volumes of usage feedback on them from the largest C++ communtiies, way way before C++1y. Specifically (fyi, in order of my preferences for future votes!), these are:

&quot;N3401 - Generating move operations&quot;.
&quot;N3423 - Lambda Correctness and Usability Issues&quot;.
&quot;N3418 - Proposal for Generic (Polymorphic) Lambda Expressions&quot;.
&quot;N3444 - Relaxing syntactic constraints on constexpr function definitions&quot;.
&quot;N3436 - std::result_of and SFINAE&quot;.
&quot;N3398 - String Interoperation Library&quot;. (useful easy win)
&quot;N3399 - Filesystem Library Proposal (Revision 3)&quot;
&quot;N3427 - Shared locking in C++&quot;.
&quot;N3421 - Making Operator Functors greater&quot; (useful easy win)

Additionally:
Microsoft makes massive investment donation to Bjarne et al., to get Modules, Concepts, Multimethods, and Open Type Switch into C++1y, and further reference implementations out, if possible, out sooner.

It is Christmas nearly, after all. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last time it was an announcement of Microsoft&#039;s cross-platform GPGPU library (can&#039;t remember the name) so my guess would be something like that.

					<description><![CDATA[Uhm, since we&#039;re around the switch between daylight and standard times which occurs on different dates in different time zones - could you give us non-Americans the time in UTC?
IIRC Pacific Daylight Time is UTC -7hr, Pacific Standard Time is UTC -8hr. So this would be either 7:45pm UTC or 8:45pm UTC, depending on whether you still have PDT on Friday, right?]]></description>
