					<description><![CDATA[Guys, the XP stuff works with the Windows 8 SDK.  No need to change to the other platform toolset if you really don&#039;t want to.  I have done a lot of testing with very large projects.  The reason they do this (state that the separate 7.1 SDK toolset is required) is to protect themselves for future &quot;breaks&quot; of the Windows 8 SDK, so they don&#039;t have to ask the Windows team to support Windows XP in the Windows 8 SDK.  But unofficially, it supports it fine.  The ONLY change you need to make to your project is to change the linker subsystem from 6.0 to 5.01.  That&#039;s it.  Of course, Windows 8 SDK has removed a lot of obsolete headers, such as MAPI, outlook headers, etc.  So if you really want to support those old headers, use the 7.1 SDK toolset.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@John: This decision is likeyl beyond the scope of the Visual Studio team. For the PSDK guys, this would mean they have to support XP with every update of the SDK - remember, the SDK isn&#039;t just headers. *I* wouldn&#039;t want to make that promise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;because we had to target a different SDK&quot;

You didn&#039;t *have* to -- you chose to.

&quot;Windows 8 SDK has officially dropped support for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003&quot;

From my perspective, that&#039;s a bug in the Windows 8 SDK.  A bug reported long before the product shipped, that could have been fixed before RTM if you wanted to.  Instead, you made a choice to &quot;support&quot; XP with the least work possible (least work for you, not least work for ISV&#039;s).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Re why ship this as a distinct toolset: It&#039;s because we had to target a different SDK. One of our team members has responded with more details on the linked blog post&#039;s comments... repeating here:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Ibrahim Damlaj] The reason we have reintroduced the Windows 7 SDK is that the Windows 8 SDK has officially dropped support for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. What this means is that the binaries under the “Windows Kits/8.0/bin” directory are no longer guaranteed to generate code that runs on Windows XP/2003. Additionally, the Windows 8 SDK headers and libs may have removed deprecated Windows XP APIs with no mitigation. [Y]ou may choose to target the standard SDK by not switching to v110_xp. However, if your application compiles and runs we cannot guarantee it will continue to do so in future releases and updates of Visual Studio.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So to ensure that XP targeting really does create binaries that can run on XP, you have to target the Windows 7 SDK, and that means a different toolset target.]]></description>

Why do i say that then you might ask... because of a certain fruit company :) that dumped a lot of money into a certain compiler so MS must dump money in VC++ or it will become irrelevant for native devel on Win, what is ofc unacceptable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Too bad it requires Yet A Build Target, requires an older SDK, and doesn&#039;t support remote debugging.

But at least it&#039;s a step in the right direction, compared to the clusterf**k &quot;multitargetting&quot; of previous versions. Kudos for listening to your users and at least doing an honest attempt :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hugely disappointed that Microsoft introduced a new toolset to handle XP.  Are you trying to make XP support painful?  If some damn fool broke the SDK headers in Windows 8, (1) said fool should be fired (which will make Mini-MSFT happy), and (2) the headers should be fixed.  The SDK headers are already full of #ifdef&#039;s to selectively expose API&#039;s based on target OS version.  Shipping the Windows 7 headers is a huge kludge to avoid doing the job properly.]]></description>
