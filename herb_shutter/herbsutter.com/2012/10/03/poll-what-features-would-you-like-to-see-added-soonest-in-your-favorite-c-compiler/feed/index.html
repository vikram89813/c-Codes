					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll comment separately because some of my items aren&#039;t on the list:
1)  Conformance 1
2)  Conformance 2
3)  Compile time improvements on large code bases, esp. with heavy template use.
3a)  As part of this, supply better diagnostics about where the compiler is spending its time  (preprocess/parse/template processing/compile/optimize)
4)  Static Analysis improvements:  This isn&#039;t a canonical part of a compiler, but there are functions performed by static analysis tools that could be done much more effectively if they could draw on the information a compiler has available.  For example:
4a) Dependency analysis:  Aside from providing a dependency tree itself, where are header files being #included when forward decls could suffice?  Where are header files *not* being included where they should be?  Are all of my header files properly guarded against multiple inclusion?
4b)  PCH analysis:  How many times is each header file getting compiled?  How much time is this wasting?
4c)  Value tracing:  Where did the value of this variable come from?  Let me trace it back for some distance.
5) Template debugger:  Compiling templates is like running a program, but our ability to debug this process is still stuck in the equivalent of the printf() days.  It would be very nice to be able to single-step the metaprogram as it runs, and to see the virtual program that is being created, before it gets handed off to the main part of the compiler.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. About the variadic templates: I&#039;m not sure why implementing this is so hard but as my imagination(sorry! I have no source of the cl.exe so I have no clue about &#039;how&#039;) you may implement a v.t. decoder into the compiler rather than analyze the code during compiling(because it take long time and highly memory occupation). Comparisons to the direct compiling of v.t., the analyzing can be arranged after finishing macro decoding and before code-compiling. exports every necessary specialized templates into external temporary-headers(but should be generated by compiling system automatically rather than user). because this method can cut off any unnecessary overloaded function-templates and specialized templates classes. It may reduce the time and memory usage when the real compiling process occurs.
I can see you already having been with this temporary-header compiling method when compiling COM codes, which has been deployed several years ago.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Rick Yorgason: I largely agree, yet I want to explain while I still have different priorities.

I am on Windows all the time, and I know that Conformity should be most important, and slacking on this certainly is harmful in the long run. 

However, build times hit me all day every day, and untangling a header mess is one of the most unproductive time-wasters. 

Even when excluding secondary effects (like more frequent builds and test executions) it would be the one thing that would result in a broad scale, immediate improvement for the entire dev team. 

Even with the effor of a &quot;final untangle&quot; and moving to modules, it would be a comparedly quick improvement that beats all the fun I am planning to have with, say, variadic templates.  It is the one thing where I could get the OK for upgrading our dev env immediately. 

This may be in part a result of the project size, history and devs, but the build model of C++ simply falls flat of everything that came in the last two decades. As C++ modules isn&#039;t finalized yet, I am sure there is a time window for the VC++ team to close the most glaring omissions in the C++ standard. However, there is no single(!) other feature in the standard I am waiting for as much as this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s kind of hard to vote without the context of the compiler. On Linux, where GCC and Clang are rocking the C++11 features, I would have to vote for better better graphical debugging and code completion (eg Intellisense). Unfortunately, on Linux there&#039;s less interest in IDEs, and what interest there is is fractured, resulting in less progress.

On Windows, where VC is king, it&#039;s obvious to any C++ developer that it&#039;s sorely lacking C++11 features. And of course, this being the blog of a Microsoft dev, that&#039;s going to colour the poll results.

The term &quot;compiler package&quot; doesn&#039;t even make sense outside of Windows. Microsoft is the only vendor that so tightly couples compiler, IDE, and libraries.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Things that would have made C++ better:
1. StdGui. I am amazed that this havent yet to be standarized in C++
2. StdNet. I just want to send/receive data from computer to another computer, one solution would have been an integrated type e.g. an int where &quot;int&quot; knows where to send it.
3. True and simple parallel processing, have you ever wondered how to make several while() loops by just telling the main program what the subprogram IS ?
4. What if C++ could have an integrated script language python/lua alike? Making it both statically and dynamically typed.
5. StdFile. Just a pain to get the path of the program. (Cross platform issue)
6. Stub. Just like in Python you have the if(__main__) to make the stub so you could make components pretty easy!
7. Make a new type called &quot;text&quot;, where it is an UTF-8 string type.
8. StdHttp. Why not have a full set of tools availible to read and write to the web? hin and hout :)
9. Ability to have the binary contain a zip-file with files inside it. Much like in OSX. I know it&#039;s possible but is really a hassle to do. I would like to see it in the main().

Those things already exists in Java and Python today!
Make it happen, please.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m quite happy with the compilers I use to develop (g++, clang). Unfortunately, as an organisation, we still have to support VC++, which is somewhat behind. I&#039;d like to see cmake integration in VC++, so that I don&#039;t need to re-load the IDE so often, and for Linux IDEs, better refactoring support, and better IDE performance.
I&#039;d also like to see C99 for all compilers, and in VC++ proper C++11 support, and support for building Fortran projects in a sane way - without linking a separate static library.
I&#039;d also like to see an end to platform specific extensions, and on Windows, a proper make program (MSbuild is crap, nmake doesn&#039;t do parallel builds, and devenv is pretty flaky with huge projects).
I&#039;d also like to see library versioning on Windows handled in a sane way, with better options to control library search paths (no more setting PATH, side-by-side assemblies, or bundling lots of libraries in executable directories). I&#039;d like to see a nice way to handle late symbol binding on Windows (like RTLD_LAZY on Linux).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another problem with adding features to C++ is that it&#039;s already an insanely complex language.  I can&#039;t think of any other language which is so complicated that it can easily surprise even those programmers who have used if for years.

Template meta-programming is an interesting idea, but the resolution process can be very complex, and programmers can&#039;t watch it unfold.  So it can be nearly impossible for programmers to figure out what went wrong when a template can&#039;t be instantiated, or when unexpected runtime behavior occurs.  This is compounded by the interaction of template instantiation, function/operator overloading, and automatic type conversion/promotion.  At this point 

I think the language is so complex, and templates can lead to such crazy problems, that a overhaul is in order.  The creation of Java was a step in the right direction, but Java&#039;s &quot;write-once, run-anywhere&quot; approach precluded applications requiring the fastest-possible performance, or precise control over memory and low-level hardware details.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Re C++11 conformance: There is not yet any 100% conforming C++11 compiler — even the gold-standard EDG compiler has not implemented it all; they don’t have raw string literals for example — but all of us vendors are working on it, and based on what I’m hearing I continue to expect to see *multiple* reasonably-fully-conforming implementations (i.e., including all the big things like variadics, initializer lists, async/future, atomics, etc.) shipping in 2013.&quot;

The latest info I can find on EDG is from back in December 2011 and doesn&#039;t actually indicate all that much C++11 support.

Judging by this page (http://wiki.apache.org/stdcxx/C%2B%2B0xCompilerSupport) at the moment Clang seems to be at the top (sort of amazing considering that two or three years ago clang didn&#039;t support C++98) followed closely by gcc.

Although really I&#039;m just glad that things seem to be progressing so much faster across the board than implementing the original ISO standard did (at least for the major compilers; there are still some like the compilers for HP and Solaris that it seems there&#039;s little hope for).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Herb

Your general comment doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense to me. I&#039;m not clear it addresses my questions either. Being general, though, I take it that it was not supposed to.

In any case, I stand by my earlier comment, and add a response to your last one. The reason your &quot;general comment&quot; sounds all well and good but leaves me concerned still, is this:

First, you make it sound like Microsoft is a lot less far behind (than the rest of the field that matters), than I believe Microsoft really is, r.e. C++11 language features. But we&#039;ll &quot;soon&quot; see on that, won&#039;t we?

Second, when you seed your poll of &quot;what people want on all compiler products and platforms&quot;, as you have, with at least 3 *critical* things, and ones your main competitors already have - and you are lacking in - you invite readers to infer that if they voted for refactoring (for example), over implenting all of the C++11 language features, then that&#039;s what we&#039;d get. i.e. the language features might get delayed even further. When MS/we are already working with an already unknown timeframe for full C++11 language features, that&#039;s a worry.

Also, when 2 things are essential, arguably 3, so let&#039;s call it 2.5. and we can only pick 5 things in total, then to my mind 50% of my votes are &quot;wasted&quot; having to vote on things that everybody else has. That&#039;s less of a deal than it first seems! Just saying! And who cares about the answers for those 3 criticals - other vendors have already answered the call. They are here. Where are you?

But the main issue is giving the impresssion you&#039;d delay C++11 language features. They are too much of an enabling thing for everyone. To let people infer those criticals are up for negotiation by having them in the list is a mistake; and even more so, when you mention &quot;real soon now&quot; when it&#039;s really &quot;real soon now, for what features, exactly?&quot;. The implication that the C++11 language features could be voted off of the island is unthinkable. You must see that?

So simply put, Conformance Part I and Part 2, just shouldn&#039;t be in your list because they should not be negotiable because they are a must for the good of the C++ community. Keeping them in your list suggests anything could happen to them, and is praying to the same god that lets common sense slip right past focus groups. The same way those crazy capital letters and colours got approved. Don&#039;t let that happen here.

This is a gut call, and the reason for my post and why I am asserting that even the idea of delay here calls Microsoft&#039;s commitment to C++ into question. Please clarify that with times and rough dates for exactly what of those language features.

In my view, you should be driving the C++ language features hard, as critical, non-negotiable items that will get done as soon as possible at any (reasonable) cost and at the expense of any other feature (except bug fixes). To do other, just hold&#039;s up the industry because  C++11 languages features are the number 1 must have and you are best disposed to deliver those for Windows. If for some outside reason you believe any specific language feature is a bad idea to implement and shouldn&#039;t be delivered, I&#039;d be open to hear that as an excuse, but that&#039;s about it.

The other fluff, particularly re-factoring, anyone can deliver, and probably will. If you don&#039;t want to leave yourself open to competition on those other fronts whilst being tied up implementing C++ language features, hire more staff!

I am interested in the other items you mentioned such a checked pointers (an eventual inevitable *option*) etc. but only as nice to have, so I&#039;ll save that for another post as this one is already long enough.

Thanks for the poll, I&#039;ll be keenly interested to see what other view points show up.

Thanks

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Herb</p>
<p>Your general comment doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense to me. I&#8217;m not clear it addresses my questions either. Being general, though, I take it that it was not supposed to.</p>
<p>In any case, I stand by my earlier comment, and add a response to your last one. The reason your &#8220;general comment&#8221; sounds all well and good but leaves me concerned still, is this:</p>
<p>First, you make it sound like Microsoft is a lot less far behind (than the rest of the field that matters), than I believe Microsoft really is, r.e. C++11 language features. But we&#8217;ll &#8220;soon&#8221; see on that, won&#8217;t we?</p>
<p>Second, when you seed your poll of &#8220;what people want on all compiler products and platforms&#8221;, as you have, with at least 3 *critical* things, and ones your main competitors already have &#8211; and you are lacking in &#8211; you invite readers to infer that if they voted for refactoring (for example), over implenting all of the C++11 language features, then that&#8217;s what we&#8217;d get. i.e. the language features might get delayed even further. When MS/we are already working with an already unknown timeframe for full C++11 language features, that&#8217;s a worry.</p>
<p>Also, when 2 things are essential, arguably 3, so let&#8217;s call it 2.5. and we can only pick 5 things in total, then to my mind 50% of my votes are &#8220;wasted&#8221; having to vote on things that everybody else has. That&#8217;s less of a deal than it first seems! Just saying! And who cares about the answers for those 3 criticals &#8211; other vendors have already answered the call. They are here. Where are you?</p>
<p>But the main issue is giving the impresssion you&#8217;d delay C++11 language features. They are too much of an enabling thing for everyone. To let people infer those criticals are up for negotiation by having them in the list is a mistake; and even more so, when you mention &#8220;real soon now&#8221; when it&#8217;s really &#8220;real soon now, for what features, exactly?&#8221;. The implication that the C++11 language features could be voted off of the island is unthinkable. You must see that?</p>
<p>So simply put, Conformance Part I and Part 2, just shouldn&#8217;t be in your list because they should not be negotiable because they are a must for the good of the C++ community. Keeping them in your list suggests anything could happen to them, and is praying to the same god that lets common sense slip right past focus groups. The same way those crazy capital letters and colours got approved. Don&#8217;t let that happen here.</p>
<p>This is a gut call, and the reason for my post and why I am asserting that even the idea of delay here calls Microsoft&#8217;s commitment to C++ into question. Please clarify that with times and rough dates for exactly what of those language features.</p>
<p>In my view, you should be driving the C++ language features hard, as critical, non-negotiable items that will get done as soon as possible at any (reasonable) cost and at the expense of any other feature (except bug fixes). To do other, just hold&#8217;s up the industry because  C++11 languages features are the number 1 must have and you are best disposed to deliver those for Windows. If for some outside reason you believe any specific language feature is a bad idea to implement and shouldn&#8217;t be delivered, I&#8217;d be open to hear that as an excuse, but that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p>The other fluff, particularly re-factoring, anyone can deliver, and probably will. If you don&#8217;t want to leave yourself open to competition on those other fronts whilst being tied up implementing C++ language features, hire more staff!</p>
<p>I am interested in the other items you mentioned such a checked pointers (an eventual inevitable *option*) etc. but only as nice to have, so I&#8217;ll save that for another post as this one is already long enough.</p>
<p>Thanks for the poll, I&#8217;ll be keenly interested to see what other view points show up.</p>
<p>Thanks<br />

					<description><![CDATA[General comment: I really did mean this poll to ask about what C++ developers want on all compiler products and platforms, not just VC++.:) In particular, it was prompted because several people have recently again prompted me about refactoring, and I&#039;ve just never felt the need myself, but maybe I don&#039;t get out enough, so instead of assuming I thought I&#039;d ask the question. I will be sharing the results of this poll with the C++ committee in general as input into our October 15-19 meeting as it will help inform our post-C++11 work which is really accelerating now.

Re C++11 conformance: There is not yet any 100% conforming C++11 compiler -- even the gold-standard EDG compiler has not implemented it all; they don&#039;t have raw string literals for example -- but all of us vendors are working on it, and based on what I&#039;m hearing I continue to expect to see *multiple* reasonably-fully-conforming implementations (i.e., including all the big things like variadics, initializer lists, async/future, atomics, etc.) shipping in 2013. As for Microsoft&#039;s product specifically, we&#039;ve said we&#039;re planning to ship out-of-band releases &quot;soon after VC++ 2012&quot; (which is soon indeed now!) and particularly that we want to take advantage of that capability first to deliver more and more batches of C++11 features, first in a CTP (community tech preview) or similar form. Based on that, one could divine that the first batch shouldn&#039;t be far away...

I plan to share more information about both of the above -- ISO C++ standardization progress going strong this year that will benefit C++ on all platforms, and a concrete update on recent VC++ progress since VC++ 2012 recently shipped in particular -- in a talk around the end of this month. I&#039;m not sure yet whether that talk will be broadcast live on the web (decision not yet final), but it will be recorded for on-demand viewing (usually with a few days&#039; delay to get it up on the site) and I&#039;ll provide information and links here as they become available. Stay tuned.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Herb

I&#039;ll do my own poll here.

Does anyone else thinks it&#039;s frankly insulting to keep being asked about language conformance priority at a time when everyone else has already conformed?

I&#039;m absolutely all for asking my priorities in advance, so credit there, but repeated dumb questions about language conformance really just attack Microsoft&#039;s credibility.

Just do the conformance already!! At least regarding part I, and II. I don&#039;t know what else you had in mind for part III, you weren&#039;t specific.

I think this poll could have been better explained/organised but that&#039;s no big dea compared to my real beef:

To keep asking about conformance in terms of priority, when your competitors are already there on those C++ features, suggests a lack of resources - or why ask?

Except Microsoft doesn&#039;t/shouldn&#039;t lack resources. If you say it does, I&#039;ll tell you that must mean what Microsoft is really lacking is commitment! - exactly for the reason that everyone else already has conformance, even open source! So what is the real reason here? 

Is it because you don&#039;t want to put those resources into an old compiler while you develop a new one, and want the rest of us wait around forever while you catch up, or what?

It also doesn&#039;t make sense not to do conformance first, because when those C++ features are done (which you voted for so I assume you value them), you, and more importantly, we, can use them in improving and writing code easier that will create better versions of all the other features you talk about.

What exactly is wrong with this logic?

I want to be pro Microsoft but I find Microsoft&#039;s credibility constantly on the line, stumble after stumble, while everyone else quietly get&#039;s on with it. It may seem harsh but Microsoft wouldn&#039;t be here if it wasn&#039;t for it&#039;s own dumb fault. Even if you get there in the end, what a drama on the way!

You&#039;ll probably tell me other people don&#039;t value conformance as highly as me, but just so you know in advance, that wont wash with me - that whole pre-text of this vote is misguided. I&#039;ve given you good reasons why. If that ends up being your best answer, I&#039;ll watch the ensuing flame fest and we can both count votes. I think Microsoft lacks common sense.

Anyway, here&#039;s my 5 votes. If the public agrees, vote for me!

Stop breaking things that already work is number 1.
Fix your bugs is number 2.
C++11 language features is job number 3.
Build/link performance is number 4.
Hiring a clown off the street to fix the icons/colours that the last clown messed up would also be a nice to have. 5
Anything after that is up to you!

That&#039;s my priorities list. Now, people, vote for me!!! I want to be in charge! :)

PS
I&#039;ll switch my &quot;other&quot; vote for modules to build/link performance instead. I&#039;m pragmatically assuming you&#039;ve got no chance in hell of getting anywhere near preparing for modules in my lifetime and when you do they&#039;ll be a technology lock in. So you might as well get the build/link performance up sooner however you can while we wait for ever for perfection.

					<description><![CDATA[Herb by the power of Haskell Curry I force you to add the option: add proving that changes to a pure function require only small patching of the exe instead of compiling the entire source again. Also restrict would be nice nonISO addition to MSVC, or #pragma pure for portability]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with the clamor for build time improvement (ccache!) and module support. I develop cross-platform so most of my pain is in the differences between compilers. To offer some radical ideas, I&#039;d love MS support for Clang in VS/Windows. Managing the various makefile formats is also a headache that isn&#039;t improving over time. With CMake support I would no longer have to suffer the ritual of: close VS, sync, rebuild my projects, reopen, wait for parsing.]]></description>
