					<description><![CDATA[@jagansai: i dont think thats accurate. ever heard &quot;java is the new cobol&quot; expression? java lost a lot of ground the last couple of years, the lack of of new features that have been asked for years (is java7 ready yet?!).

while i kinda agree on C#, its really because c# is light years away from java in so many aspects wouldnt be practical to enumerate them all here. and while adopting the new C++ features might take a while they will be adopted even if it takes 5-10 years, theres just too many C++ code bases there to move them all to a new language.

also C++11 is such an improvement on the language, i for one am extreamelly happy with them, and while i cant use the new features at job (not all of them anyway) i can use whatever vc++2010 provides since thats what i use at work, and lambdas are just delicious :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Herb,
All this is fine. But, you know what ? Most of the code bases in application programming are moving at a steady rate to Java / C#. I hear more of Java madness. Most of the places where c++ code is on UNIX platform are not bothered about the changes to the language since they are anyways using an age old c++ compiler.]]></description>
