					<description><![CDATA[@Nikhil, @Rahul:

To develop Metro style apps, the Windows team&#039;s guidance is that they equally (really) support C++, .NET, and Javascript, and to use whichever you&#039;re most comfortable with and meets your needs. If you&#039;re most familiar already with C# and are happy with its performance and environment, use it. If you&#039;re most familiar with C++ or want its extra efficiency and determinism (e.g., cleaning up WinRT stream objects efficiently and promptly by default), use it. Or write different parts of your app in all three; it works.

BTW also note that &quot;Metro style apps&quot; != &quot;Win8 tablet apps&quot; because the latter is a superset that also includes DirectX, for which you&#039;d want to use C++.]]></description>

Also, I&#039;ve updated http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/GoingNative-2012 to make this distinction very clear.

					<description><![CDATA[Herb,

I would like to ask you the same question that Nikhil has asked but I will put it in a different way. The question is being Microsoft being so aggressive in 

1. Making the un-managed code perform faster on their platforms.
2. Making the performance of managed code better day by day.

Why should the developers use C++ instead of C#. Don&#039;t get me wrong as I am a big fan of C++ and worked with C++ for almost 6 years (recently shifted to C#). I also like what Microsoft is doing with performance optimization for managed code and the new platforms being able to run them in a better way. I am just curious because shifting from C++ to C# felt like &quot;Man, things became so easy now, i can finish up early and efficiently without worrying about dormant leaks and bugs in my code.&quot; and I presume many guys would have felt the same (Nikhil could confirm). so now I should pick up C++ for development on future versions of windows. 

I am saying this with no means of offending anyone (I see 2 rate downs in Nikhil&#039;s post), I am just curious whether I should ever be going back to the world of C++ or not.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb,

 I am a developer and have coded in C++, VC++ MFC, Delphi, C#, ASP .NET MVC2. I have a question regarding C++ in Windows 8.

Why should developers or companies consider using C++ instead of C# or Html5, Javascript to develop Metro applications? It seems that it is quicker to develop in these languages than writing code in C++. The impression that I have gotten from the videos of the build conference is that the performance hit is not significant in case of  C# in Windows 8 as the .NET framework is not there or when using Html5, Javascript. It would be significant to use C++ only when one is writing games or high performance software. It seems like C++ has been killed in Windows 8!

					<description><![CDATA[The comments on streaming are confusing.  They say it&#039;s &#039;live&#039;, but then also say they&#039;ll be available 24 hours after the sessions.  Are there two options?  I.e. one stream available *live* as it happens and then recordings available the next day?  Or are they exaggerating when they say &#039;live&#039;.

I&#039;d like to organize a viewing party, but I&#039;d really need these details to be more clear first.

Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Michal, there is no cost for watching the live stream. The only price is your time! All sessions will be made available for on-demand viewing (in multiple formats) ~24 hours after the event. 

I guess the no-cost-for-wathing-the-live-feed information needs to be stated on the event page. Done :)

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry if this is the wrong forum to ask this question, but: is the live streaming free, or must you purchase an event ticket?

The cost is fair and not prohibitive (excellent!), but the purchase ticket form seems to imply that tickets for the physical event, with no mention of online streaming.]]></description>
