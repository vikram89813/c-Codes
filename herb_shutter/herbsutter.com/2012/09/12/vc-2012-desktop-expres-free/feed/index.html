					<description><![CDATA[@GregM: The Microsoft C++ compiler version 11 is something like a decade old at this point.  But I know you meant the C++ compiler (version 17.x?) bundled with Visual Studio 2012.

For an exact lockdown date, you&#039;d have to ask the compiler team.  I might have overstated when they go to fixing crashes only, regressions can also get fixed in late stages of the release cycle.  But I can say from experience that real bugs and standard conformance issues have to be submitted long (12 months or more) before release, or else I get told they don&#039;t meet the triage bar for the release-in-progress.

And one of my beefs with Microsoft&#039;s bug reporting system is that bugs that miss the triage bar tend not to get tracked for the next release either, even though it isn&#039;t in lockdown.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I downloaded and installed the Visual Studio 2012 Desktop; but cout &#060;&#060; __cplusplus still gives me 199711.

Any guess about when we&#039;ll have the full C++11?  (All I need is the compiler that I can run from the command line and the standard library.  I don&#039;t need to do any GUI stuff.)

Thanks,]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@peeterjoot: You do need to register using the link in the dialog -- registration is free, you usually get one marketing message when you register, and you can un-check the &quot;send me occasional email&quot; boxes. There are no commercial restrictions on apps built with Express -- it&#039;s for both commercial and non-commercial use.

@Anuj: This release includes essentially the entire C++11 standard library, and also adds some C++11 language features -- range-for, override, final, and a few other small updates. As alluded to above, and announced in February at GoingNative, soon after VS 2012&#039;s release we plan to have out-of-band releases with additional C++11 language features... that&#039;s why I wrote &quot;more to come in the coming months.&quot; Stay tuned!]]></description>

I rather have a low prices personal-use-only edition which is full featured (at least up to the pro version (team foundation features are useless for personal use anyway ;)

I had such a bad experience with VS2008 C++ express that never looked into any express version again. The problem was that I couldnt build against windows runtime :)  I had to download win2003 SDK !!!! while working on winXP, just so I can build very simple projects targeting win32 :((]]></description>

Really? You&#039;re giving C++ code analysis tools away for free, yet you won&#039;t let Express users have *plugins*? At home, I&#039;m stuck on VS2008 because Microsoft discontinued the reasonably-priced Standard Edition after 2010, so I&#039;d have to pay ~$500 just to get back Visual Assist (which is non-negotiable as far as I&#039;m concerned). Yet you&#039;re willing to give out a quality code analysis tool.

I&#039;m not against code analysis; it&#039;s very important. But if I had to pick which feature I wanted in VC++ Express, the ability to use plugins would be preferable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very pleased to see Microsoft restore this to their dev tool portfolio. Now pre-Professional young developers can pick up a copy of the 5th edition of the &#039;C++ Primer&#039; (so good, even seasoned C++ devs should give it a look) and work away learning the fundamentals of C++ 11 using the time honoured console application as their lab bench.]]></description>
