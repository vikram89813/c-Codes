					<description><![CDATA[@Amit: No and yes. C#/.NET has its place, and C++11 has its place, too. It depends on the software you are building, and of the circumstances, if you should prefer C# over C++. It&#039;s all about choosing The Right Tool For The Job. Know your tools and their advantages and drawbacks. 
So: No, it&#039;s not time to abandon C#, but Yes, it&#039;s about time to learn C++, as it has become an even more powerful tool for your toolbox than it was before.
I am using C++11 for some months now and started learning C#, to have a tool where C++ doesn&#039;t fit that good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, love your stuff! I am a very lucky person. I have worked on cobol compilers, fortran, Java and am now  working on a project using Java 7 invoke dynamic. Why am I saying this? My point is that many people talk from the view point of loving one lanuage. I miss working in cobol - it seems I can love anything. Your post misses that most important difference between c++ and the major oo managed languages. Shame on you for not selling c++! Memory safety is old hat and actually c++11 is dissapointingly bad at it (shared pointers are slow and saying you should take references to them is a cop out). But, with raii c++ has resource management. Making sure file handles, sockets and other precious resources are used properly is very much more important than worrying about leaking memory.]]></description>
