					<description><![CDATA[@Glen.  I see your point and agree that initially the lambda chaining and call back styles are hard to parse. However, I suspect that is largely because they are different. If one were to come to }); from scratch, with no pre-existing expectation, one would not need to get used to it. As someone who programs in very many languages all the time - I find there is a lot of benefit in learning to parse new and different constructs and embrace the cognitive challenge that involves.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@alexander turner. I for one, definitely find this call chaining style very hard to read. I am 100% certain we need an improved syntax to make this call back style more accessible and natural. I think this is an issue separate from concurrency but would benefit both areas.

@Herb, is the committee open to syntax changes to C++ Next to make the callback process nicer?

As much as I like the lamda capture mechanism and don&#039;t wish to be critical there, the whole f( [] ( X&#038; a ) { called_back_with( a ); } ); syntax hurts and makes for inside out code. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever get used to the } ); syntax even, let alone the inside out coding pattern it seems to induce.

I&#039;d love to see more ideas to improve this.

Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The restful web-service stuff looks interesting. However, the call chaining is much more significant.It will be interesting to see how the C++ community warms to this style of programming. In my view it is a very powerful technique indeed with implications far beyond futures. In general - call chaining makes it possible to write non imperative code without excessive boiler plate. http://nerds-central.blogspot.com/2011/12/is-curry-saviour-of-java.html in the Java community it is starting to take hold but is still resisted by may people who say the style is hard to read.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Jeffrey: fair enough, especially when worded that way.

On the other hand, I love python dearly.  Not for the language, but for the library they have given me.

I welcome many more additions to the C++ standard library for useful programming tasks, though yes, I do think there is a line at some point.

Another option that Herb alluded to was to create a new de-facto standard library that has faster turnaround times for updates (much like boost), though I don&#039;t think boost was mentioned as a potential target (for whatever reason).  I don&#039;t want to put words in Herb&#039;s mouth, so please clarify if I misunderstood.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a bit confused as to what&#039;s being hopefully-standardized.  I see that the futures stuff might be a worthwhile addition to the standard library, but a &quot;RESTful services library&quot; seems fit for Boost instead.

I don&#039;t want the C++ standard library to turn into the Java standard library kudzu, where 25% is solely for XML processing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Herb,
It looks like the C++ teams over at Microsoft are creating some serious product demand here :)
Good job, thumbs up! (but also: give us the code please.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[yes, yes, YES!

Herb, I have been waiting patiently since GoingNative to see some steps towards the dream of having a more &quot;batteries included&quot; C++ standard[-esque] library.

I&#039;ve recently been teaching C++ to my younger brother, and this experience has opened my eyes to how the language feels to a novice.  Yes, some of the syntax is rough to grasp (why do you need a semicolon after a class?), but it was the standard library that proved the real problem.  It is both difficult and extremely limiting when trying to just &quot;hack up something fun&quot; while incrementally learning the language.

Access to GUI/canvas proved impractical (we are using different compilers/os).  Networking was difficult (and more c than c++).  Keyboard/mouse event handling.. we just gave up.

Unless we were doing academic exercises like writing algorithms already in the standard library, nearly all of our practical time was spent in c++/system dependent drudgery instead of building, and left a foul taste in his mouth, and frankly a bit of shame in mine.

Sure: use the right tool for the job -- maybe hoping for easy access to a ui canvas was a bit optimistic -- but networking?  This should be c++ bread and butter.

I am going to give this new library a shot, and while I don&#039;t usually use visual studio, this gives me some good motivation (does microsoft release these libraries under some kind of permissive license that may allow for porting?).

Thanks, and looking forward to more!]]></description>
