					<description><![CDATA[@Simon: I didn&#039;t mean to stop improving the skills with the technology you currently use (C++ in that case), but it always helps to broaden your horizon.
For example, Scala also helped me to write better Java code.

					<description><![CDATA[I agree. The difference can be huge. I think good programmers always learn something new.
Have been doing RDBMs for many years? Learn NoSQL databases.
Have been doing C++ for many years? learn Java or C#.
Have been doing Java for many years? Learn Scala,  Clojure or C++11
etc, etc.

The sad thing is that many companies don&#039;t pay good developers much more than average developers and then tend to not get the really good ones.
