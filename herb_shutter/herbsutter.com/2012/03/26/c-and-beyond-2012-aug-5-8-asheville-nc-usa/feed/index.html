					<description><![CDATA[@Csaba: I&#039;m glad you enjoyed GN! Doing Going Native livestream required facilities and infrastructure not available at most hotels and conference centers and prohibitively expensive if you&#039;re not a big corporation willing to sponsor it out of the goodness of your heart -- a studio-quality equipped auditorium with manual and robotic cameras, a fat and fast and reliable Internet connection, datacenter infrastructure capable of handling very large numbers of live viewers, as well as an on-site A/V crew of about a dozen people. That was possible only because Microsoft wanted to sponsor it out of their own pocket to help get top-notch freely available C++11 content out on the web as widely as possible, to fill a gap and promote industry-wide learning about modern C++. But hopefully the technology (like Lync and WebEx) and infrastructure (like hotel Internet pipes) will continue to get more capable and affordable so that smaller conferences will be able to do more of this in the future. In the meantime, I&#039;m hoping for another Going Native again next year, we&#039;ll see...!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Going Native conference was live streamed, and I followed both days. Will there be any live stream this time? Sorry, I know this question kind of intersects with Tamas&#039;s question, but there&#039;s no way I could pay 2.4K for the conferene. It&#039;d be a dream!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Tamás: We generally don&#039;t record talks, sorry, but sometimes they do get recorded and put online. You can find the following talks/panels from last year&#039;s C&#038;B online courtesy of Channel 9&#039;s Charles Torre:

My opening talk on &quot;Why C++&quot;: http://tinyurl.com/3gj3hzv . Note this talk is more keynote-y and not code-focused because its purpose was to say some stuff that needed saying to set tone and perspective, and to provide a linkable place online to help disseminate understanding of where, and why, C++ matters.

Scott/Herb/Andrei panel on &quot;C++11&quot;: http://tinyurl.com/3h8kt9y

Scott/Herb/Andrei panel on &quot;Ask Us Anything!&quot;: http://tinyurl.com/89d8nlz

Scott/Herb/Andrei panel on &quot;Concurrency &#038; Parallelism&quot;: http://tinyurl.com/bmvts25

Bonus post-C&#038;B interview with all three of us: http://tinyurl.com/3ero4l6]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My bet: The keywords are perhaps volatile and static

The standard has changed for both and they are not often highlighted (static initialization is now thread-aware; I guess volatile isn&#039;t in the focus of attention because no compilers (that I know of) fully implement the important bits (atomic and friends) of C++ multi-threading features?]]></description>
