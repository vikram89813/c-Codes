					<description><![CDATA[I just watched the talk on youtube, really great one. One comment about the syntax change with class() really got me thinking about how metaclasses could be used when combined with each other.
I came up with a different implementation (or at least some kind of sketch) of your property example (https://godbolt.org/z/1tE3Hy), where the property support can be opted in and property members are just marked.
There are a lot of things I don&#039;t know how they work but it is still a lot of fun to play around with this feature.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Greg Yes, this is the 5th talk in a line that deserves to be connected together by a Simplicity theme, because that&#039;s what motivates the topics. The topics otherwise look very different, but all are motivated and tied together by that central theme, and are central to achieving that theme.

In slightly more detail:

CppCon 2014: How to use smart pointers (remove classes of errors with manual delete), how to initialize variables, and how to pass parameters (just the latter is ~9% of all published C++ rules, seriously, no kidding... I counted)

CppCon 2015: The Guidelines launch, and the Lifetime profile in particular to address dangling pointers/iterators/etc. (both about encouraging simpler code and removing classes of errors and latent bugs)

CppCon 2016: How to use smart pointers (in more detail), and leak-freedom to address the cases where we do need to express actual or potential cycles (experimental approach of tactical GC arenas)

CppCon 2017: Mini intro on spaceship comparison, then reflection+generation+metaclasses to simplify writing classes (for both comparisons and class authoring, the common theme is less boilerplate + removing classes of errors)

So simplicity is the theme that ties them together.]]></description>
