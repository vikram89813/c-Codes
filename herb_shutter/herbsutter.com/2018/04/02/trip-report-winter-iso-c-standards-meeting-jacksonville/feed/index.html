					<description><![CDATA[Shouldn’t std::chrono::weekday Sunday have the same number as ISO-8601 (i.e. 7 instead of 0) ?

The std::chrono::minutes literal (“min”) is as consistent as ‘u8’, ‘u’ and ‘U’ (that of cource should be u8, u16 and u32 from day one (consistency is a virtue)). Is it because not to clash with any possible ‘m’ for month (that of cource should me ‘M’ (once again as the ISO-8601 mandates)) ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If the major reason for [likely] was using it to speed up rarely occuring paths, why wasn&#039;t it named to make the intention clear without requiring comments? The most obvious name would be [fast_path] and [slow_path]. Can this issue be fixed before C++20 is finalized?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[even more great compile-time stuff coming. i love it. i have been using concepts at home (we don&#039;t use gcc at work) for a long time and it&#039;s a joy. i would take it even without terse syntax, and can&#039;t wait for it to be in place in the other compilers as well. however p0745r0 looks great. naming the type and multiple constraints, mm, mm, mm! i did not even consider the call-site template / type / value ambiguity yet, also a good improvement.

class-types in non-type template parameters is a solid addition with potential for glorious insanity.

regarding p0939r0: does &#039;visitor pattern&#039; in 4.3 Concrete Suggestions refer only to the double-dispatch technique used when you are abstracting via inheritance, or also to the visitor when abstracting via variant? is it possible to be a even more concrete about what constitutes low level-use, why the variant discouraged, and what is encouraged in instead?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Regarding span (which I otherwise love except for this one aspect), would it bring over its perf-killing bounds check upon every deference in release mode? That would be inconsistent with std::array[i] and std::vector[i] (which are fine to assert in debug mode, but have no overhead in release mode for well-formed code).]]></description>
