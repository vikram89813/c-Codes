					<description><![CDATA[Hi Herb,

You mentioned prior years talk on this material with regards to non-owners. Could you perhaps provide a link to which talk this is, I can&#039;t seem to find anything. Thanks in advance.

Btw, Thanks for this great talk really improving and deepening my experience with handling ownership in some of the complex systems I&#039;m looking at!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting talk, as always.

I think there’s a slight error on slides 19/20 about the iterative destructor, but please excuse me if I’m wrong.
Your algorithm iteratively finds a leaf and then destructs it, so the runtime should be O(N*h), where h is the height of the tree. Of course, for balanced trees h=log N, as you wrote. But your example of the linked list being a degenerate tree shows that this is actually worst-case O(N). Actually, the same holds for the default recursive destruction, which uses O(h) stack space. There you have listed it as &quot;O(N) stack space&quot;, not only O(log N) (in which case it probably would not be a problem).
So I think that the worst-case run-time for your iterative destruction (in this particular implementation) is actually O(N*N).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Herb, thank you. Knowing which objects point to which other objects however, can&#039;t you add a library function to traverse the graph marking the elements as well as executing a user provided functor and call collect minus the tracing step at the end?

					<description><![CDATA[@Pim: Yes, in the current implementation you do lose the ability to merge the marking with a normal graph traversal that the program would have done anyway. By decoupling it, the tradeoff is that you can choose to give that up in favor of that you don&#039;t have to write the tracing logic yourself, and also gain more control over when/where tracing runs (e.g., it doesn&#039;t have to wait for a caller to traverse, or be on a caller&#039;s thread).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Herb,

I just watched this (great) talk and I very much like the [code]deferred_heap[/code] idea. However I do see one potential downside by factoring it out this way (which may not actually exist so feel free to tell me to RTFC). By having [code].collect()[/code] do the tracing do you not lose the ability to merge the marking step with a normal graph traversal?

Cheers,

Pim]]></description>
