					<description><![CDATA[@codant I&#039;m not sure that involves any less cheating (or that there is any cheating), and in both cases we are storing a pointer and a destructor function, so we have the same space footprint. However, doing it the way you suggest erases both the destructor and the object pointer -- making the latter also be invisible loses the ability to later query the object pointer to determine if the object lives in a given memory allocation. Also I think the code is simpler the way it is in the post and in the repo.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My question was about inheritance and if the have deferred_ptr of type base but pass an object of type derived that is inherited from base when we call the destructor which destructor are we calling the base class&#039;s or the derived class&#039;s destructor because for this to work we would need to call the derived class&#039;s destructor or else we have resource leaks for the object the derived object used.

					<description><![CDATA[@Vishal I didn&#039;t quite parse your question, but the key is that we are constructing a T object and know the correct type of the complete object, so we store that destructor. Regardless of whether the last deferred_ptr keeping it alive is a deferred_ptr or something else, such as a deferred_ptr or deferred_ptr or deferred_ptr, the correct T destructor will be called to clean up the complete object. I&#039;ll add a note about this to the post. Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Greg: vector&#060;T, deferred_allocator&#060;T&#062;&#062; can be useful for other types, though the following is a more speculative use case right now: Notably, with a deferred_allocator, the memory stays live even when the container is no longer using it as long as some iterator is, and so simply dereferencing an invalidated iterator is type- and memory-safe (a stale-data problem rather than undefined behavior); however, incrementing/navigating using an invalidated iterator is no better than today.

					<description><![CDATA[I just watched the talk, and I was reminded of a question I had the first time I read through the slides.  Is the deferred_vector only intended to store deferred_ptr objects, or can it be used for other things?  If it&#039;s only for deferred_ptr, would it be useful to make this explicit and have it be deferred_vector being std::vector&#060;deferred_ptr, deferred_allocator&#060;deferred_ptr&#062;&#062;?  I was thinking that might not be immediately obvious as containing pointers, so maybe deferred_ptr_vector.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I think you’d have to write a constructor&quot;

I keep forgetting, until I write it and the compiler yells at me, that emplace_back doesn&#039;t work with aggregate initialization.  Is that something that could possibly be fixed someday?

&quot;just to be able to make the add-a-destructor call site slightly longer as well&quot;

If you normally put spaces inside the braces, it&#039;s actually one character shorter... ;)
[code]
push_back({ foo, bar });
emplace_back(foo, bar);
[/code]

I can&#039;t wait to see this talk get posted.  I always enjoy your talks.  I miss C++ and Beyond. The timing of CppCon just hasn&#039;t worked for me. :)]]></description>

Because I was missing the ref-qualifier on x it really screwed me up because it called my template constructor to incorrectly copy x from the vector. Once I either added the ref-qualifier there or removed the const qualifier on rhs for my copy constructor things worked much more as expected.]]></description>
