					<description><![CDATA[Huge THANK YOU!  To you Herb, to everyone on the standards committee, to everyone in the TSes, and so on!!!
C++ is finally becoming what it always should have been and far more!  Making chaining work properly - finally - omg - finally defining a coherent ordering for such things, and making overloads use the same ordering as the operator they&#039;re overloading?!!!!   Are you kidding me!  NIRVANA!  So many wonderful things here, and so much dedication by all of you.  I can&#039;t express my appreciation adequately. :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Adam: The best place to find some stories is to search for &quot;trip reports&quot; on isocpp.org, which often include stories and would give you specific people to contact individually to ask for more.

Ah, good point: Normally I do write auto&#038; on parallel algorithm invocations, now fixed. Thanks. (Because each parallel invocation is on a different element of the range, there&#039;s no data race assuming the elements don&#039;t share state further down under the covers, and so no reason to copy the elements, plus this allows updating the element in-place and works with noncopyable types.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, 
please forgive me for going completely off topic. I am preparing a talk on &quot;[Features of] Modern C++&quot; for my colleagues. I have the features under control but...

C++ had (apparently) been in a standstill for some considerable time before it suddenly took a huge leap. I would like to include a &lt;b&gt;short section&lt;/b&gt; on the propelling motivations and forces, that got things moving. With you as one of those forces, I would greatly appreciate some hints on where to find stories (even if anecdotal) that I could refer to. Many thanks!

Kind Regards

					<description><![CDATA[Herb, Thanks for an excellent meeting report that goes a long way toward demystifying the current standardization process.

My comment has do to with release cadence. As someone who has been using C++ professionally for over 25 years, I remember clearly the Bad Old Days when the language evolution was excruciatingly slow. The expectations around language rate of change of many professional engineers of my generation were formed during this period. Most of them, now in management positions, have not adjusted to the idea of even a three-year cycle, never mind a two-year. In the East Coast technology job market, it remains very difficult to hire smart engineers that have sufficiently deep understanding of C++. The number that have any significant understanding of &#039;modern&#039; C++ is vanishingly small. In job descriptions that come through my inbox, I am still not seeing any mention of C++11/14 skills. Yes, some companies are making the switch, and it appears that the change is being driven from of bottom up. Even so, from what I am hearing from my network in Boston, the switch to C++11 remains a tough sell. In cross-platform environments, the foot-dragging at MSFT VS organization is uniquely unhelpful. But the adoption hurdle also has a lot to do with resistance to new concepts in an &#039;ain&#039;t broke, don&#039;t fix it&#039; mindset. This resistance seems particularly strong in organizations, such as those in defense and other &#039;hard&#039; engineering sectors, that have traditionally used C++ for performance reasons. A year and a half out, I&#039;ve yet to hear of a single company fully embracing C++14.

So, while I personally would love to see a two-year cycle, I don&#039;t know that it would be helpful to the overall usefulness of C++.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Joe: You can see the parts of LibFund1 that were adopted at the linked paper. Basically, everything except a couple of things that hadn&#039;t been implemented yet, in particular the invocation traits which require compiler support and are still awaiting an implementation to get experience (experience with both implementing it, and then with using it once it&#039;s in a compiler for people to try out).

@Yupei: Inline variables got design approval in EWG and is awaiting the authors to bring specification wording to Core for review. Looking at the Jacksonville Core notes, it looks like they noted they are still expecting it and I think they&#039;re planning to look at the wording at our next meeting in June.

@mbw: I occasionally see a suggestion for &#039;restrict&#039; but it&#039;s not obvious to everyone that C chose the right semantics and that the feature carries its weight -- and if it were done in C++ it would require a bit more detail because C++ has more features to integrate it with.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looking forward to the additions, it kind of feels like christmas is coming.

If I remember correctly, c++11 did not add a &quot;restrict&quot; qualifier because there were uncertainties on how it should be treated in combination with lambda closures. Is it in the realm of the possible that we might see this kind of feature in the upcoming standard? Please think of us poor number crunchers out there!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Markus: Thanks for the suggestions! We&#039;ve pondered using something like Discourse. Re Concepts, it&#039;s is in Stage 11 -- a published TS &quot;beta feature branch&quot; that&#039;s nearly ready to merge and repeat Stages 6-10 in the IS &quot;trunk&quot; itself.

@feeded: I wasn&#039;t sure if anyone was using the blog categories so I stopped adding them a year or two ago. Now that you&#039;ve noticed, I&#039;ve gone back and added the &quot;C++&quot; tag to this and other posts. :)

@Timothy: Not that I know of. Personally I’m a big fan of multiple languages and language design, and while I&#039;m sure committee members are aware of other languages, I think the committee is doing the right thing: Moving C++ itself ahead to stay current with its bread-and-butter goal of being a portable close-to-the-metal language that gives you rich abstractions that are also very efficient. It is very easy to be distracted by chasing perceived competitors instead of keeping one’s eyes on one’s own ball.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062; `path` defines implicit conversion to `string` and thus can be used in every case where string is currently used, including fstream constructors. (The corresponding note mentions exactly this use case).

Not good enough. One of the good things about `path` is that it can encode Unicode paths. The goal would be the ability to do this:

fs::path pth = ...; //Get a path with possible Unicode characters.
std::ofstream strm(pth);

That won&#039;t work with an implicit conversion to `std::string`. At least, not on Windows. The Windows version of iostreams cannot use UTF-8 paths. The only APIs that can take the full set of Unicode strings use 16-bit `wchar_t`-based strings.

`path` gives us a way to make this platform-independent. We can use UTF-8 strings, feed them into `path`, and if the implementation needs to convert it into UTF-16, so be it. And vice-versa.

The problem is opening a file with it. Implicit conversion to `std::string` will not help, for the above reason. Even implicit conversion to `basic_string` won&#039;t work, because `std::ofstream` cannot take a `std::wstring`. It only takes `char*` and `const string&#038;`.

This needs to be standardized.

Also, we need versions of fopen that will take `path` as well. More people use the C file IO than the C++ file IO, particularly in production code.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this detailed overview and explanation of the current way of working!
It all seems to be a lot more work than is visible from the outside.
Thus, also many thanks to you experts bringing in those new features and ensuring the quality of future C++.

However, having read other trip reports and reddit discussions I&#039;m wondering what is meant by often mentioned more experience and user feedback. I feel the barrier to express simple positive feedback on a proposal or experimental implementation to be quite high. Writing an email to the authors with a complaint or bug report appears much more likely to happen.
Have you considered something like a stackoverflow/github site for C++ proposals? That would give many of us average programmers the possibility to easily comment on and, possibly more importantly, up-vote or down-vote both a proposal and other comments. In particular for controversial features such direct positive and negative user feedback might help getting faster to an agreement. Or, it might bring up the need for other features not yet considered necessary. Also, perhaps more people would volunteer and start working on or testing experimental implementations, in particular in those early stages.

Finally, at which of the 11 stages would the Concepts TS be currently?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think in context of the &quot;when&quot; over &quot;what&quot; attitude of C++14 and C++17, it makes sense to seriously consider a 2-year cadence. There is a lot of disappointment (AFAICT) over what did *not* ship in C++17, but that&#039;s because now we have to wait 3 years at minimum to see those omissions in an IS. This is especially disappointing when hearing that a feature like Concepts was very nearly ready *now*. Switching to a 2-year cadence may make each release less impressive, but it will soften the blow to users anticipating certain features that don&#039;t make it and possibly reduce pressure to shoehorn things into each IS if it&#039;s &quot;close enough&quot;.

Though, starting a 2-year release cadence on an odd-numbered year makes me cringe inside.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@petke: Concurrency 1 was only just completed at the last meeting, so it was a little too early to propose merging it into trunk, as the trunk is close to shutting down to stabilize and ship C++17.

@jmckesson: I believe people are busily writing papers on how to apply string_view throughout the standard library. The committee felt that shouldn&#039;t be gating factor to ship string_view itself, which is well understood and can deliver value to user code today even as the standard library works on potentially adding it pervasively as a separate step.

@farid:  That&#039;s the basic idea, in particular to have left-to-right evaluation for everything except assignment which naturally flows right to left. Check out the link to the paper for details.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad to see many of the Library TS features go into the standard, as well as the FileSystem TS.

My biggest question is about system&#039;s integration: what is being done to actually incorporate these new library elements within the rest of the standard library?

For example, FileSystem TS defines a path type. But *nothing* actually uses it directly. Not `std::fstream`, not `fopen`, not one single standard library file processing function takes it. Will `string_view` overloads be added for `std::stoi` and its ilk?

And what of combinations of such elements? Will `path` allow you to get a `string_view` of its contents? Will `path` be constructible from a `basic_string_view`, just as it is from a `basic_string`?

These TS&#039;s are all designed to be stand-alone. But once they become a part of the standard, then they need to work well with each other. We really need different parts of the standard library to work well together.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the trip report. I have been refreshing this page for a week in anticipation :)

What is the status of the &quot;Concurrency 1 TS&quot; though? It seems to me some features there are low risk, widely useful, and has a number of mature implementations. 

I&#039;m thinking of the std::future improvements. Especially the &quot;then&quot; continuations and the heterogeneous &quot;when_any&quot; would make std::future much more useful. Are these not mature enough to be split out of the TS and be shipped in C++17? There are many years of of experience with using them in PPL (+power pack), TBB, HPX, etc. Is there any issues holding this back for another 3 years?]]></description>
