					<description><![CDATA[@jmckesson from wg21 mailing list I noted at least 2 proposals fixing controversial stuff:

2 ways to define concepts:

strange meaning of func(Concept a, Concept b):

					<description><![CDATA[Has there been any serious discussion in the committee on improving the Concepts TS, in accord with some of the deficiencies that have been discussed? In particular, I&#039;m talking about two main issues:

1: Concept definitions. That is, having two different ways to specify concepts. A solid paper on this problem was written; have any solutions to this issue been discussed?

2: The new template induction syntax (with the curly braces). I have read somewhere that the Ranges TS people basically refused to use it in their specification. Perhaps that part should be removed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the report! Great to watch the progress. I hope to attend a meeting one day :-)

What would be the best place to learn about the discussions on a specific proposal? E.g. I&#039;d be quite interested in the discussion on p0426r0 (&quot;Constexpr for std::char_traits&quot;).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You guys are doing really great job!
&quot;Depending on timing, Modules TS and Coroutines TS too might be done and published in 2017.&quot;
Wow!!!
Thank you Herb, for the insights of the meeting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, I think standard at the moment has too many almost done stuff in the air... I wish at least one of the big 3: ranges, concepts, await made it in IS.
Anyway I really fear that this will turn into a branch hell with different compilers implementing different stuff and if there are breaking changes between TS and future IS it will be ugly...]]></description>
